    <pre class="nfo">In April 2002 groups across the 0day scene united to update the current rules to better shape todays scene. Below is detailed information on updated rules as well as new rules. These rules must be recognized and followed immediately on this date, April 12, 2002.

1. Max one version per application / 14 days.

2. 0day rips should not contain free software which can be downloaded from the web, such as DirectX/Acrobat Reader.

3. To prevent sloppy rips, a re-release of a 0day application is allowed to make groups release proper and respectable releases. In order to be considered as legit, the re-release must be at least 15MB smaller than the previous release. The following provisions include:


a) No essential data is allowed to be removed to be considered a valid re-release. A re-release from a competing group may not use tools, cracks nor any other files from the previous release that were modified for the original rip.

b) The re-release of a rip can be done by any group and must be done within 48 hours after the release of the original rip.


4. Rips created with another groups ISO are to be nuked unless the ISO group have given it&#39;s permission to have their iSO ripped.

All appointed HQ (Headquarters) should abide by these rules to the fullest extent permutable. Any group that competes in the 0day rip scene will and must abide by the above rules to allow fair competition among all competitors. Take into account that these rules do not apply to nor concern the game rip scene.

Leaders, Council Members and Seniors of Blizzard, Caudex, Core, Digital Factory, Oddity, Orion, The Millenium Group, Epsilon, Eclipse, Embrace, Renegade, Intension, Paradox, Prime, Among others!</pre>
