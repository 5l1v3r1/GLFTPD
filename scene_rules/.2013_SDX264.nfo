&#9474; A lot has changed since 2009, when the last revision of the XviD rules was  &#9474;
&#9474; released. While these rules have served us well over the years, the need    &#9474;
&#9474; for a change has come. The weaknesses of the XviD codec have become obvious &#9474;
&#9474; and as habits change the need for strict size-based releases has gone.      &#9474;
&#9474; After the non-retail TV scene moved to x264 the advantages of the codec     &#9474;
&#9474; over XviD for SD resolutions became clearer for everyone and with CRF in    &#9474;
&#9474; the mix, we can also ensure that the diverse array of material will get     &#9474;
&#9474; the most appropriate bitrates and not arbitrarily fixed sizes. So once      &#9474;
&#9474; again the active TV &#38; Movie groups have gathered to bring the retail SD     &#9474;
&#9474; rules in line with other sections using x264.                               &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474; 1.4) Movies split into 2 discs (ie LOTR Extended) must still be pred as     &#9474;
&#9474;      one file, assuming the movie only has start credits on D1 and end      &#9474;
&#9474;      credits only on D2.                                                    &#9474;

&#9474;      settings different to the main footage, except as follows:             &#9474;
&#9474;      With sources where only credits are interlaced, you may either leave   &#9474;
&#9474;      the credits interlaced or de-interlace the credits ONLY, but you must  &#9474;
&#9474;      NOT de-interlace the whole footage.                                    &#9474;

&#9474; 2.1.1) Black borders must be removed completely with cropping. Where the    &#9474;
&#9474;        video has changing ARs, it must be cropped to the widest frame.      &#9474;
&#9474; 2.1.2) Height and width must be mod2.                                       &#9474;
&#9474; 2.1.3) Over/under-cropping by more than 1px is considered a technical       &#9474;
&#9474;        flaw. It is recommended to crop the 1 pixel out.                     &#9474;
&#9474; 2.1.4) Video AR must be within 0.5% of the original AR.                     &#9474;
&#9474; 2.1.5) AR for all releases must be based on the actual source AR, not on AR &#9474;
&#9474;        listed on IMDB, cover or other sources.                              &#9474;
&#9474; 2.1.6) In rare cases where the source AR is incorrect (i.e. bad mastering), &#9474;
&#9474;        a source sample and a comparison screenshot explaining how you came  &#9474;
&#9474;        to the corrected AR is required.                                     &#9474;

&#9474;        FS as 1.36, is not allowed.                                          &#9474;
&#9474; 2.1.8) Only sharp resizers such as Lanczos/Lanczos4, Spline36, or Blackman  &#9474;
&#9474;        are allowed. Simple resizers (bicubic, simple, etc) are banned.      &#9474;

&#9474; 2.3.1) Sources with a horizontal resolution of 720 will be cropped as       &#9474;
&#9474;        required and only the height must then be resized to the closest     &#9474;

&#9474; 3.1) MUST be as close to original source framerate as possible.             &#9474;
&#9474; 3.3) In some cases PAL movies need to be IVTC&#39;d (e.g. to 24fps). Therefore  &#9474;
&#9474;      using a PAL source is not an excuse for lack of IVTC.                  &#9474;
&#9474; 3.4) Hybrid sources will be left to ripper&#39;s discretion when it comes to    &#9474;
&#9474;      IVTC, but they must explain and provide source proof for any use, or   &#9474;

&#9474;  3.5.1) Provided that the initial release was encoded from a source which   &#9474;
&#9474;         required restoration; a native source may be released at a later    &#9474;
&#9474;         date. Such a release must then be tagged as NATIVE and the original &#9474;
&#9474;         release will not be nuked. This rule, however, does not apply for   &#9474;

&#9474;         all episodes, however for a maximum of 25% of the total episodes    &#9474;
&#9474;         different CRF values can be used to allow for variations in source  &#9474;
&#9474;         material, compressibility etc.                                      &#9474;

&#9474; 7.9) Hardcoded subtitles are only permissible when present in the source.   &#9474;
&#9474;      If the subtitles overlay both active video and matting (black bars),   &#9474;
&#9474;      cropping to the bottom of the subtitles is permissible, and an equal   &#9474;
&#9474;      amount of matting shall be left at the top. If the burned subtitles    &#9474;
&#9474;      overlay only matting, they must be OCR&#39;ed and cropped out.             &#9474;
&#9474; 7.10) English subs must be synced with the video.                           &#9474;

&#9474;       be tagged with the spoken language. Releases with English subtitles   &#9474;
&#9474;       MUST NOT be tagged with the spoken language. A release containing     &#9474;
&#9474;       English subtitles after a foreign-tagged release is not considered a  &#9474;
&#9474;       dupe, regardless of whether or not the foreign-tagged release has     &#9474;

&#9474;       the new release contains more picture area than the original release  &#9474;
&#9474;       (provide sample from the original release or JPG screenshot of the    &#9474;
&#9474;       same frame in both releases showing additional area). A release not   &#9474;
&#9474;       documenting additional picture area is considered a DUPE.             &#9474;
&#9474; 12.3) Wider wide screen where more of the original source is visible is     &#9474;
&#9474;       valid and not considered a dupe but must be tagged as WS not PROPER.  &#9474;

&#9474; 14.1) ALL retail (including R5) releases MUST now include source proof in   &#9474;

&#9474;       Photograph (not scan) of the actual physical disc (printed side)      &#9474;
&#9474;       with a group tag in JPEG format. The image must be good quality with  &#9474;
&#9474;       disc details clear and readable. Small portions containing sensitive  &#9474;
&#9474;       information may be blurred or blackened.                              &#9474;
&#9474; 14.2) The proof picture(s) must have unique filenames and be in a separate  &#9474;
&#9474;       directory named &#39;Proof&#39;.                                              &#9474;
&#9474; 14.3) Cover scans and m2ts/vob samples may be added but DO NOT count as     &#9474;
&#9474;       sufficient proof.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474; 14.4) Releases that fail to pre with such proof are to be considered a nuke &#9474;
&#9474;       and can be propered. Proofixes later than 4 hours from pre (if a      &#9474;
&#9474;       proper has not been pred during that time) will not be accepted.      &#9474;
&#9474; 14.5) For TV series one of the following is allowed:                        &#9474;
&#9474;        a) Include a proof image with all the discs in the first pred        &#9474;
&#9474;           episode of the set.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;        b) Include a proof image of the relevant disc in every episode of    &#9474;

&#9474;        c) Include a proof image of the relevant disc once in one episode of &#9474;
&#9474;           your choice from that disc. In this case you MUST mention in all  &#9474;
&#9474;           the relevant NFOs the release name where proof can be found.      &#9474;
&#9474;        d) Include a proof image of all the discs in every episode of the    &#9474;
&#9474;           set.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474; 14.6) It is ESSENTIAL to make sure EXIF metadata is removed from your image.&#9474;

&#9474;        a) Come from a DVD source.                                           &#9474;

&#9474;       to ALL the rules of this document, except for the proof rules. Such   &#9474;
&#9474;       releases are not considered retail however, so retail DVD or BD rips  &#9474;

&#9474; 15.6) SD WEBRips from sources that offer SD downloads such as iTunes must   &#9474;
&#9474;       follow this ruleset without reencoding where possible. HD downloads   &#9474;
&#9474;       must be reencoded.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   15.6.1) WEBRips that are &#34;capped&#34; such as Netflix, Amazon VOD, etc must   &#9474;

&#9474;   15.6.2) Proof must be a screenshot of the download in progress.           &#9474;
&#9474;   15.6.3) BDRip/DVDRip can be pre&#39;d after WEBRip - WEBRip is NOT allowed    &#9474;
