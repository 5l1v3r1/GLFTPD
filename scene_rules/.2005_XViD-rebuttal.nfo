&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; To introduce myself first...I am a member of one of the oldest active XviD  &#9474;
&#9474; release groups and one of main writers/contributors to TDX2k2. Neither I,   &#9474;
&#9474; nor my group was informed of this new ruleset. That is reflected in the     &#9474;
&#9474; fact that we are not a signatory. I find it astounding that the writers of  &#9474;
&#9474; this ruleset can give &#34;respect&#34; to the previous TDX teams but at the same   &#9474;
&#9474; time self-proclaim themselves to be the new TDX team and write a new ruleset&#9474;
&#9474; without even consulting them. In fact, not even half of the of the (active) &#9474;
&#9474; groups to whom the main TDX2k2 writers belonged have signed off on TXD2k5.  &#9474;
&#9474; Several of the oldest XviD groups have not signed TXD2k5, but instead of    &#9474;
&#9474; any attempts at compromise, the new ruleset was steamrolled through without &#9474;
&#9474; them or their input.                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; As a result of these strong-arm tactics, I am now forced to point out each  &#9474;
&#9474; any every flaw that the TXD2k5 authors are forcing the XviD scene to        &#9474;
&#9474; swallow. The TDX2k5 ruleset was meant to plug the holes in TDX2k2 and some  &#9474;
&#9474; had hoped it would usher in a new era in MPEG-4 based encoding. Sadly, this &#9474;
&#9474; abomination does neither. Within the ruleset guideline below, I have        &#9474;
&#9474; included my rebuttal comments. While many of my points might seem to be     &#9474;
&#9474; bordering on anal, it is my opinion that a ruleset must be precise and      &#9474;
&#9474; concise. It should eliminate all ambiguity and close all loopholes.         &#9474;
&#9474; As you will see, I find that this new ruleset does neither. The scope of    &#9474;
&#9474; the rules is adequate, but it could have gone a lot further in some areas,  &#9474;
&#9474; and went too far in others. TDX as a ruleset must curb the release of bad   &#9474;
&#9474; rips, while at the same time it cannot impede a ripper&#39;s ability to create  &#9474;
&#9474; the highest possible quality rip. I do also acknowledge that some of the    &#9474;
&#9474; words and ideas that I contest in my rebuttal were present in TDX2k2. This  &#9474;
&#9474; does not excuse TXD2k5 of having the same problem since the TXD2k5 writers  &#9474;
&#9474; had the choice to edit or reword anything they felt appropriate.            &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; I know that some people will just dismiss this as me holding a personal     &#9474;
&#9474; grudge or think that I&#39;m just out to pick a fight. If you take the time to  &#9474;
&#9474; read my rebuttal comments, you should find them to be valid concerns. I     &#9474;
&#9474; truly care about the future of the MPEG-4 scene and am deeply troubled when &#9474;
&#9474; I see a document like this being flaunted as a new ruleset.                 &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; This document is meant only as a rebuttal of the TXD2k5 document and is not &#9474;
&#9474; intended as a reflection of any of the signee groups. I know that many of   &#9474;
&#9474; the groups that signed did so blindly in order to support what appeared to  &#9474;
&#9474; be a positive advancement for the XViD Scene. As such, I&#39;m not suprised by  &#9474;
&#9474; the number of obvious errors that I was able to locate when picking it      &#9474;
&#9474; apart. I don&#39;t believe that having signed TXD2k5 precludes any group from   &#9474;
&#9474; lending their voice to anything that might arise from the dialogue that I   &#9474;
&#9474; hope to have started. I would encourage all groups who agree with any of my &#9474;
&#9474; points to speak their mind, whether it be with me or the writers of TXD2k5, &#9474;
&#9474; or even in a public forum or their own nfos. I welcome any groups to        &#9474;
&#9474; include this nfo or their own rebuttals with their releases.                &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; Thank you for your time.                                                    &#9474;

&#9474; P.S. I find it strange how TXD2k5&#39;s intro is written in the first person    &#9474;
&#9474;      singular when it is supposedly an intro from the entire new TDX        &#9474;
&#9474;      committee...                                                           &#9474;

&#9474;   - PAL (25 fps) = MINIMUM runtime is 100 minutes/CD.                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - FILM (23.976 fps) = MINIMUM runtime is 105 minutes/CD.                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - NTSC (29.97 fps) = MINIMUM runtime is 87 minutes/CD.                    &#9474;
&#9474;   - These runtimes are scalable via the following equation:                 &#9474;
&#9474;     N CD time minimum = (N-1) * allowed time where N is number of CDs and   &#9474;
&#9474;     allowable time applies to fps as outlined above:                        &#9474;
&#9474;     i.e. 3 CD FILM rip minimum = 105 x (3-1) = 210 minutes.                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - MINIMUM time length rule is as implied - that is the MINIMUM time per   &#9474;
&#9474;     CD -- NOT MAXIMUM!!! (i.e. no such thing as &#34;must be more than 1 CD&#34;)   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Release runtime must be at least 50 minutes for using the full burnable &#9474;
&#9474;     media capacity. In such cases, releases MUST utilize a MINIMUM of       &#9474;
&#9474;     680mb of the 700mb standard burnable media (Multi-CD releases MUST      &#9474;
&#9474;     conform to the 680mb minimum, for each CD used). Any other use of the   &#9474;
&#9474;     media shall not be over 350mb (Sizes between 350mb to 680mb are not     &#9474;
&#9474;     allowed).                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Media usage is at ripper&#39;s discretion, please use it.                   &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - The runtime rule is still a slightly vague and occasionally contested   &#9474;
&#9474;     issue within TDX. The new wording doesn&#39;t change this at all. The       &#9474;
&#9474;     correct interpretation of this rule is that it is permitted to use an   &#9474;
&#9474;     additional CD for every additional x minutes beyond the original x      &#9474;
&#9474;     minute runtime (x being the runtime based on the framerate). The way it &#9474;
&#9474;     is currently worded can still be interpreted such that each CD MUST     &#9474;
&#9474;     have at least x minutes on it.                                          &#9474;
&#9474;   - With the improvements in encoding technology, I don&#39;t understand why    &#9474;
&#9474;     the new ruleset would be trending towards less compression with the     &#9474;
&#9474;     modified length rules.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - The first time I read the new point that was added, I thought that it   &#9474;
&#9474;     related to shorts but apparently it&#39;s not. The point just seems to      &#9474;
&#9474;     bumble around. Couldn&#39;t it just have been simply stated that the        &#9474;
&#9474;     minimum capacity used on a CD is 680MB? The 50 minute rule should have  &#9474;
&#9474;     just been included in some new rules about the runtime of shorter       &#9474;
&#9474;     features (which I definitely feel is needed). The new TDX implies that  &#9474;
&#9474;     everything under 50 minutes can be ripped to 350MB, but doesn&#39;t a 350MB &#9474;
&#9474;     rip of a 5 or 10 minute short seem a bit oversized?                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - Why is the capacity of a CD not explicitly defined? Is it 700MB even    &#9474;
&#9474;     (734,003,200 bytes)? 702MB (which will still fit on a CD)? or something &#9474;
&#9474;     else? There have been several releases between 700 and 702MB, is that   &#9474;
&#9474;     allowed?                                                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - So what are the rules for non-standard framerate releases? There are    &#9474;
&#9474;     plenty of silent films that IVTC to 16 to 22fps...                      &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  AUDIO:                                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST be MP3 or Studio AC3 (AC3 transcoding forbidden).                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST be STEREO for STEREO sources, MONO for MONO sources                &#9474;
&#9474;     (MONO audio as STEREO on source is considered a MONO source).           &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST BE VBR! NO CBR MP3!                                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - MP3 tracks must have the original frequency as it was on the DVD&#39;s      &#9474;
&#9474;     audio: i.e. 48khz for 48khz and 44.1khz for 44.1khz.                    &#9474;
&#9474;   - MP3 files must be normalized.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   - ABR is considered a VBR technique.                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   - AC3 MUST be used wisely and correctly. Ripper&#39;s discretion on when to   &#9474;
&#9474;     use it. Using or not using AC3 IS NOT a technical flaw.                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - MONO AC3 is not allowed, in that case must encode to mono MP3.          &#9474;
&#9474;   - Multi-language audio tracks are FORBIDDEN! (Use INTERNAL!)              &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Please define mono. The term was incorrectly used in TDX2k2 and has     &#9474;
&#9474;     caused all sorts of issues. Technically speaking, any audio track with  &#9474;
&#9474;     identical channel(s) is mono. Of course, the intention is to forbid the &#9474;
&#9474;     use of 2.0 Mono MP3/AC3, but once again, this is left unclear.          &#9474;
&#9474;   - The term source also needs definition. Is it the source AC3 track on    &#9474;
&#9474;     the DVD? The original theatrical master? This ruleset still doesn&#39;t     &#9474;
&#9474;     clear up whether a DVD should be encoded in stereo when the studio      &#9474;
&#9474;     remasters a mono theatrical track into 2.0 (Stereo) or 5.1 audio.       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Why MUST MP3 need to be normalized? Wouldn&#39;t minimal processing of a    &#9474;
&#9474;     track be ideal? The rule also doesn&#39;t state the extent to which the     &#9474;
&#9474;     audio must be normalized. Without that, the rule means absolutely       &#9474;
&#9474;     nothing.                                                                &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  VIDEO:                                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - Keyframe:                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;     MUST be &#60;=20 seconds and MUST be inserted according to scene changes    &#9474;
&#9474;     and framesizes as determined by the codec or encoding application.      &#9474;
&#9474;   - Group watermarks of any kind on the video will not be tolerated!        &#9474;
&#9474;   - Intermission messages must be removed from the avi!                     &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - I know the intermission rule is personal. I still maintain that there   &#9474;
&#9474;     is often wonderful musical accompaniment during the intermission and    &#9474;
&#9474;     that would be lost if that rule is kept in effect. Sometimes the        &#9474;
&#9474;     intermission is used as a directorial tool as well, so removing it      &#9474;
&#9474;     would alter the flow of the movie. If removing the climax of a movie is &#9474;
&#9474;     frowned upon, shouldn&#39;t the same common sense lend itself to any other  &#9474;
&#9474;     part of a movie?                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Framerate:                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST be as close to original source framerate as possible.              &#9474;
&#9474;   - In some cases PAL movies should be ivtc&#39;d (i.e. to 24fps). Therefore    &#9474;
&#9474;     using a PAL source is not an excuse for lack of ivtc.                   &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Once again, the term source needs to be defined. While it seems obvious &#9474;
&#9474;     to most what the correct framerate should be, there are some that think &#9474;
&#9474;     that the NTSC telecine framerate of 29.97fps is the &#34;source framerate&#34;. &#9474;
&#9474;   - Hybrids? What are the guidelines for ripping hybrids? What would        &#9474;
&#9474;     make a hybrid encode properable? Hasn&#39;t this been a hot enough issue to &#9474;
&#9474;     address?                                                                &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Codec:                                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST BE XviD (all DivX codecs are banned).                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST use 2 pass technique during encoding.                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - NO DUPES BASED ON CODEC TYPE, USE INTERNAL!                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Resolution and Aspect Ratio:                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Width: 512 - 672 pixels for WS movies (Letterboxed is considered WS).   &#9474;
&#9474;            448 - 576 pixels for FS movies (Only 4:3 images).                &#9474;
&#9474;   - Height and Width: Must be a multiple of 16.                             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Cropping is required to be the MAXIMUM possible (black borders must     &#9474;
&#9474;     be cropped to their maximum). Over cropped releases are considered      &#9474;
&#9474;     a technical flaw. Some movies present changing ARs, in that case the    &#9474;
&#9474;     cropping applies only to the image that presents more pixels (Means     &#9474;
&#9474;     that part of the movie will have bad cropping).                         &#9474;
&#9474;   - Movie encodes must be within 5% of the original aspect ratio.           &#9474;
&#9474;     Calculating AR % error: (Release AR - Original AR)/Original AR x 100    &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Due to the popular 1.37:1 AR, the FS rule should probably be extended   &#9474;
&#9474;     from the 4:3 definition to any AR 1.4/1.5:1 and narrower. It&#39;s obvious  &#9474;
&#9474;     that 1.37:1 isn&#39;t widescreen.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   - The term &#34;bad cropping&#34; is kind of silly. It&#39;s either overcropped or    &#9474;
&#9474;     undercropped. Once again, the wording of the 3rd point is imprecise.    &#9474;
&#9474;     Why not just say what correct cropping is and go from there. The        &#9474;
&#9474;     &#34;maximum possible&#34; cropping is just to crop the whole frame away. The   &#9474;
&#9474;     rule regarding a source with varying ARs is appropriate but again badly &#9474;
&#9474;     worded. How does cropping apply to anything? Does this sentence make    &#9474;
&#9474;     sense? &#34;In the case that the movie presents changing ARs, cropping      &#9474;
&#9474;     applies only to the image that presents more pixels.&#34; Huh?! How about:  &#9474;
&#9474;     &#34;In the case..., the movie must be cropped such that no frame is        &#9474;
&#9474;     overcropped&#34;. Simple.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Subs, Interactive Menus, Trailers:                                         &#9474;
&#9474;   - OPTIONAL (ONLY if all other requirements have been met).                &#9474;
&#9474;   - VOBSUB is the preferred format due to the fact it does not use OCR.     &#9474;
&#9474;     However, any format that displays with DVobSub is acceptable.           &#9474;
&#9474;   - Subtitles may be MUXED with video stream, but MAY NOT be BURNED into    &#9474;
&#9474;     video stream. MUXED subs will proper BURNED subs.                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Subtitles not muxed into video stream MUST be encapsulated in a .rar    &#9474;
&#9474;     file with the MOST compression available and shall be contained in      &#9474;
&#9474;     the directory named &#39;Subs&#39; and will NOT be packaged with main movie     &#9474;
&#9474;     rars.                                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Burned subtitles shall only be permissible when the source exhibits     &#9474;
&#9474;     aforementioned subtitles in the picture itself (i.e. Subs in the        &#9474;
&#9474;     matte portion of the picture MUST be typed in a separate file and the   &#9474;
&#9474;     frame shall be cropped). If there is a part of the burned subtitles     &#9474;
&#9474;     on the picture itself, and another part on the matte portion of the     &#9474;
&#9474;     picture, the frame must be cropped to 2 pixels from the start of the    &#9474;
&#9474;     subtitles on the matte portion. Upside cropping of the picture has      &#9474;
&#9474;     nothing to do with the downside, therefore the cropping on the upside   &#9474;
&#9474;     MUST BE to it&#39;s maximum.                                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - English subs on non English movies MUST fit on CD with main movie,      &#9474;
&#9474;     all other optional subs SHOULD fit on the CD.                           &#9474;
&#9474;   - Foreign movies (Non English Spoken) with no English subs, must have     &#9474;
&#9474;     the language name taggings (applies to the various non English          &#9474;
&#9474;     scenes). Movies with English subs present, WILL NOT HAVE any language   &#9474;
&#9474;     tag on them!                                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   - Using of hand made subs on non English releases (i.e. fansubs) MUST     &#9474;
&#9474;     be mentioned in the nfo, and at nuker&#39;s discretion if to nuke the       &#9474;
&#9474;     release for Bad.Subs, depends on how bad the subtitles are. Please      &#9474;
&#9474;     use common judgement! Releases that were nuked for bad subtitles, may   &#9474;
&#9474;     be propered only by subtitles that came from the retail DVD (Ripper&#39;s   &#9474;
&#9474;     choice if to release the full movie again or just the subtitles).       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Multi-language subtitles cannot be used as a basis for a dupe.          &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - I see nothing about Interactive Menus or Trailers, or any other extras  &#9474;
&#9474;     for that matter.                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;   - As we appear to be still using the avi container, it is not possible to &#9474;
&#9474;     mux subs into the actual container (which is what muxing actually means)&#9474;
&#9474;   - I&#39;m not sure about the mandatory use of rar. I know there are certain   &#9474;
&#9474;     (standalone) players that wouldn&#39;t read through the rar. Not that       &#9474;
&#9474;     many (if any) current standalones play Vobsubs anyway.                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - I&#39;ve always loved this 1/2 matted burned subs discussion. Doing it the  &#9474;
&#9474;     way that the ruleset indicates would cause the image to be off-center   &#9474;
&#9474;     during fullscreen playback. Some people swear that they can&#39;t watch     &#9474;
&#9474;     anything off-center, personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s the end of the world.  &#9474;
&#9474;     In any event, a few of us had thought up a great compromise based on    &#9474;
&#9474;     the macroblock structure of MPEG encoding. It&#39;s too bad we weren&#39;t      &#9474;
&#9474;     consulted.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - EngSub Must fit on CD rule: See above rar comment and more above CD     &#9474;
&#9474;     filesize comment.                                                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - The next bullet...&#34;will not&#34; or &#34;must/may not&#34;? (And I find the use of  &#9474;
&#9474;     exclamation marks to be very unprofessional in a ruleset)               &#9474;
&#9474;   - How many times do I have to say it? How bad do subs have to be to be    &#9474;
&#9474;     bad.subs? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s no consensus on what &#34;common judgement&#34; is.  &#9474;
&#9474;     (judgment is misspelled too). This of course is even worse since the    &#9474;
&#9474;     rules state that if SOMEONE has made the call to nuke it for bad.subs,  &#9474;
&#9474;     then it can be propered.                                                &#9474;

&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Now that we&#39;ve cleared up what it SHOULD include, what MUST it include? &#9474;
&#9474;   - DRF. Sigh... (see more about this below)                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - Exactly what ripping method we are talking about?                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - How about...Audio Codec? XviD Build? Packed Bitstream? Max Conseq BFs?  &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Credits:                                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Movie credits can be encoded separately at a lower bitrate only if the  &#9474;
&#9474;     time length exceeds the no. of CDs used (i.e. 106 min on 1CD for FILM   &#9474;
&#9474;     source, or 201 min on 2CDs for PAL source, etc).                        &#9474;
&#9474;   - Any movies with scenes in the credits (i.e. bloopers or continuation    &#9474;
&#9474;     of story) MAY NOT be downsampled!                                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Cutting Credits is not allowed.                                         &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - I don&#39;t see the advantage in restricting when credit downsampling can   &#9474;
&#9474;     occur. There&#39;s no consistency. They&#39;re either expendable, or they       &#9474;
&#9474;     aren&#39;t.                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Samples:                                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   - REQUIRED!                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - 1 full minute in length and in a separate folder marked as &#39;Sample&#39;.    &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST be taken from the movie - NOT encoded separately.                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Vob samples are recommended for any rip that is deemed questionable:    &#9474;
&#9474;     i.e. no ivtc possible on source, ivtc to 24.975fps etc.                 &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Propers:                                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Propers are ONLY permitted in the case of a technical flaw in the       &#9474;
&#9474;     original release (i.e. Bad IVTC, Interlacing, bad number of CDs).       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Releases not nuked on release lists and/or sites MUST include           &#9474;
&#9474;     original sample of the technical flaw.                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Qualitative propers are not allowed, nor are propers based on           &#9474;
&#9474;     decisions made by a ripper (i.e. No. of CDs, AC3 or MP3, etc).          &#9474;
&#9474;   - Propers based upon the compliance with new instances of TXD2K5          &#9474;
&#9474;     guidelines are also forbidden.                                          &#9474;
&#9474;     Only propers acceptable when propering old tdx rips are propers based   &#9474;
&#9474;     on picture damage: Aspect Ratio, IVTC, Over-Cropping. Other propers     &#9474;
&#9474;     acceptable are propers based on releases that did not follow previous   &#9474;
&#9474;     tdx guidelines, at the time they were released.                         &#9474;
&#9474;   - Subbed (in original movie language) propers dubbed (in any language).   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Hardcored Subs may be propered by releases containing Vobsub/Srt.       &#9474;
&#9474;     &#60;This rule will not apply to movies ripped before TXD2K5>               &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - &#34;bad number of CDs&#34;...speaks for itself.                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - Speaking of which...something can be propered for &#34;bad number of CDs&#34;   &#9474;
&#9474;     but not for &#34;No. of CDs&#34;.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Are you expecting new instances of TXD2K5? That whole sentence needs to &#9474;
&#9474;     be rethought. &#34;Only propers acceptable&#34; -> &#34;Propers are only acceptable&#34;&#9474;
&#9474;     might be slightly better English? Although that whole sentence probably &#9474;
&#9474;     needs reworking. The meaning of &#34;old tdx rips&#34; is obvious even if it    &#9474;
&#9474;     doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. I also believe that the list of flaws was   &#9474;
&#9474;     previously called technical flaws (a couple points up, why change that?)&#9474;
&#9474;     In any event, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of other ways to reword that    &#9474;
&#9474;     bullet.                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - &#34;Original movie language&#34; -> &#34;Movie&#39;s original/native language&#34;?        &#9474;
&#9474;   - I know some people are pretty passionate about their subs, but hardcore &#9474;
&#9474;     might be going a bit to far (Yes, I know it&#39;s just a typo)              &#9474;
&#9474;   - Propers imply that there was something wrong with the original release  &#9474;
&#9474;     and it doesn&#39;t make sense to penalize a group for ripping a hardsubbed  &#9474;
&#9474;     DVD.                                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  WS vs. FS:                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - FS movies after WS was out, are FORBIDDEN unless proven it contains     &#9474;
&#9474;     more picture (use of sample or .jpg as proof).                          &#9474;
&#9474;   - WS movies after FS was out, MUST HAVE original sample from the          &#9474;
&#9474;     previous release, unless proven no WS DVD was out at the time the FS    &#9474;
&#9474;     was released. A WS not following the above is considered a DUPE!        &#9474;
&#9474;   - WS or FS name tags on the release name, if the other wasn&#39;t released    &#9474;
&#9474;     in the past, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED! &#60;use nfo to mention the AR>.        &#9474;
&#9474;   - WS cannot proper another WS: for example 2.35:1 after 1.85:1 is out.    &#9474;
&#9474;     Use the tag WS in the dirname instead. However WS after a wider WS      &#9474;
&#9474;     was released, will be considered a DUPE unless proven it contains       &#9474;
&#9474;     more picture! Sample rule applies here also.                            &#9474;
&#9474;   - Letterboxed DVDs are not considered FS even if it&#39;s FS on the source!   &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - &#34;FS movies after WS was out&#34; is also grammatically incorrect.           &#9474;
&#9474;   - Why no FS tag when it&#39;s the first one out? I can understand people not  &#9474;
&#9474;     wanting to read the nfo just to see if the release if FS or WS.         &#9474;
&#9474;   - Aren&#39;t violations of any rule not to be tolerated? Why makes this one   &#9474;
&#9474;     so special?                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Again, define source...In this case, the physical layout of the DVD is  &#9474;
&#9474;     being considered the source.                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   - This whole segment feels that it could be reworked for less redundancy  &#9474;
&#9474;     and more conciseness.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Special Movie Editions:                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   - Allowed: SE, DC, EXTENDED, UNCUT, REMASTERED, UNRATED, THEATRICAL,      &#9474;
&#9474;     CHRONO.                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - Special Edition releases without any different features in the film     &#9474;
&#9474;     itself will be considered dupes of previous releases of the same        &#9474;
&#9474;     movie.                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Shorter cut version of a movie after a longer version was released is   &#9474;
&#9474;     allowed (i.e. THEATRICAL), and MUST be mentioned in the dirname.        &#9474;
&#9474;   - Remastered movies after the original have been released are allowed     &#9474;
&#9474;     only if the original release was in BLACK AND WHITE and the             &#9474;
&#9474;     remastered edition is colour. Everything else use INTERNAL!             &#9474;
&#9474;     (Remastered DVD releases that were nuked in the past and were colour    &#9474;
&#9474;     after black and white, shall not be unnuked and shall not be duped!)    &#9474;
&#9474;   - Remastered audio will be considered a dupe if it&#39;s the only reason      &#9474;
&#9474;     movie was re-released.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Extras released in a special movie edition, cannot be used as a basis   &#9474;
&#9474;     for a dupe, unless released separately &#60;and are not dupes of previous   &#9474;
&#9474;     releases>.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - Homemade Rips are not allowed (Use INTERNAL!). For example adding of    &#9474;
&#9474;     deleted scenes, alternate endings, chrono editions. Only retail DVD     &#9474;
&#9474;     rips of this versions are allowed.                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   - NOTE: PAL - NTSC length difference comes from the no. of frames, not    &#9474;
&#9474;     extra footage.                                                          &#9474;

&#9474;   - &#34;different features&#34; -> &#34;different footage&#34;? What is a feature in a     &#9474;
&#9474;     movie and how can it differ?                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   - How about Original Black &#38; White after a studio coloured version?       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Aren&#39;t violations of any rule not to be tolerated? Why makes this one   &#9474;
&#9474;     so special?                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Uh, excuse me? PAL &#60;-> NTSC time difference comes from the SAME number  &#9474;
&#9474;     of frames being played at a different rate. Example:                    &#9474;
&#9474;     NTSC: 86400 frames &#247; 24frames/secs &#247; 60 secs/min = 60 mins              &#9474;
&#9474;     PAL:  86400 frames &#247; 25frames/secs &#247; 60 secs/min = 57.6 mins            &#9474;

&#9474;     applied&#34;. What does this actually mean? It seems redundant?             &#9474;
&#9474;   - For consistency, how about 29.97fps 23-35min or 35-50min eps?           &#9474;

&#9474;     TDX doesn&#39;t have jurisdiction over internals. Let sites and dupechecks  &#9474;

&#9474;   - Maximum VIDEO bitrates are covered by length rules.                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - If DRF average would be over 4.0, the resolution should be lowered if   &#9474;
&#9474;     possible, until the minimal res is reached. See Resolution rules.       &#9474;
&#9474;     DRF average can be checked with DRF Analyzer &#60;It is recommended to      &#9474;
&#9474;     check the full avi file and not just the sample>.                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Quant. Matrix always has to be H.263/MPEG due to lack of hardware       &#9474;
&#9474;     support for Custom matrixes.                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   - Quarterpel/GMC forbidden due to lack of hardware support.               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Packed Bitstream is not supported on some of the major gen chipsets,    &#9474;
&#9474;     therefore using it, is not recommended.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - The use of ITU-R is not recommended since it gives an AR error of       &#9474;
&#9474;     around 2% from the original DVD&#39;s Aspect Ratio.                         &#9474;
&#9474;   - Multi-language audio tracks are allowed only for INTERNALS.             &#9474;
&#9474;     Multiple languages should be interleaved into the AVI, with a           &#9474;
&#9474;     graphedit filter for each appropriate audio stream.                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - NO intros, outros, betweenos, or any other form of defacement of the    &#9474;

&#9474;  REBUTTAL:                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Our friend DRF again. DRF (Detail Removal Factor) is actually a DIVX    &#9474;
&#9474;     3.11/SBC ATTRIBUTE. XViD&#39;s equivalent attribute is the Quantizer.       &#9474;
&#9474;     Obviously I&#39;m quite amused to see DRF mentioned in this new ruleset     &#9474;
&#9474;     which abolishes SBC.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   - For those that really understand how quantizers work, especially with   &#9474;
&#9474;     regards to their relationship with the Quantization type, they&#39;d know   &#9474;
&#9474;     that the raw quant avg doesn&#39;t mean anything without the exact quant    &#9474;
&#9474;     matrix being used. As such, using the average quant as a statistic to   &#9474;
&#9474;     to determine the rip quality without considering the exact method of    &#9474;
&#9474;     quantization would be erroneous. Of course since this ruleset bans all  &#9474;
&#9474;     Custom Matrices (more on that later), that simplifies things...but MPEG &#9474;
&#9474;     and h263 are two completely different animals and look very different   &#9474;
&#9474;     at comparable quants. As a result, blind avg quant comparison is        &#9474;
&#9474;     dangerous and not a good benchmark at all.                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - While the argument about compatibility on standalones is a valid one,   &#9474;
&#9474;     many CQMs do in fact work on standalones and as long as rippers choose  &#9474;
&#9474;     well, the problems should be minor. On the flipside, the power of the   &#9474;
&#9474;     wide range of CQMs is unmatched. The choice of matrix gives control of  &#9474;
&#9474;     how XViD prioritizes the compression of the source material. The        &#9474;
&#9474;     quality of a high bitrate encode made with h263 or basic MPEG           &#9474;
&#9474;     quantization pales in comparison to one created with one of several     &#9474;
&#9474;     high bitrate matrices.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - The packed bitstream (PB) issue is one that is already solved and thus  &#9474;
&#9474;     I don&#39;t even know why it has to be brought up again. There are some     &#9474;
&#9474;     standalones that do not work with 2 consecutive B-Frames with PB and    &#9474;
&#9474;     there are some (fewer) that don&#39;t work without it. Luckily, a tool was  &#9474;
&#9474;     developed that allowed for PB to be removed from a video file without   &#9474;
&#9474;     the need to reencode. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t work in reverse (It      &#9474;
&#9474;     can&#39;t add PB to a non PB file). So really, if there were a rule, it     &#9474;
&#9474;     should be that all B-Frames must be packed, as it would be simple       &#9474;
&#9474;     enough to remove them if necessary. Alternatively, rips with 2+         &#9474;
&#9474;     consecutive B-Frames should be banned entirely.                         &#9474;
&#9474;   - Finally, this whole ITU-R thing...Specifically, the referral is to the  &#9474;
&#9474;     ITU-R BT.601 Standard for Aspect Ratios. The ITU-R itself is a body     &#9474;
&#9474;     that establishes standards, so the phrase &#34;the use of ITU-R&#34; doesn&#39;t    &#9474;
&#9474;     make a whole lot of sense. It still doesn&#39;t make sense if you           &#9474;
&#9474;     substitute in &#34;ITU-R BT.601 Standard&#34; since you abide or obey standards,&#9474;
&#9474;     you don&#39;t &#34;use&#34; them. The ruleset is probably just talking about the    &#9474;
&#9474;     Gknot checkbox. It is true that the difference between following the    &#9474;
&#9474;     standard and not doing so is about 2% on the AR. However, the jury is   &#9474;
&#9474;     still out on which is the correct way to proceed. For now, it really    &#9474;
&#9474;     seems to come down to the output device being used and what is          &#9474;
&#9474;     considered to be the &#34;correct&#34; viewing experience. Links below:         &#9474;
