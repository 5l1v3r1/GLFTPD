&#170; x264 has become the most advanced H264 video encoder over the past few      &#170;
&#170; years. Compared to XviD, it is able to provide higher quality and           &#170;
&#170; compression at greater SD resolutions. It also allows better control and    &#170;
&#170; transparency over encoding settings. With CRF in the mix, we can also       &#170;
&#170; ensure that a diverse array of material will get the most appropriate       &#170;
&#170; bitrate for them and not arbitrarily fixed sizes. This standard aims to     &#170;
&#170; bring quality control back to SD releases. There are many standalone        &#170;
&#170; players/streamers such as TviX, Popcorn Hour, WDTV HD Media Player, Boxee,  &#170;
&#170; Xtreamer, PS3, XBOX 360, iPad, and HDTVs that can playback H264 and AAC     &#170;
&#170; encapsulated in MP4.                                                        &#170;

&#170; The SD x264 TV section was formed to separate releases from the ruleless    &#170;
&#170; world of TV-XviD. This document will cover the rules and guidelines for     &#170;
&#170; only SD resolution x264 television rips.                                    &#170;

&#170;   - Sources requiring resize are to be cropped and resized using sharp      &#170;
&#170;     resizers such as  Lanczos/Lanczos4, Spline36, or Blackman. Bicubic is   &#170;
&#170;     banned.                                                                 &#170;
&#170;   - If there is a question as to the validity of a source, the release      &#170;
&#170;     may be nuked source.sample.requested_&#60;reason.for.nuke> (e.g.            &#170;
&#170;     source.sample.requested_suspicion.of.analog.source) within 24 hours of  &#170;
&#170;     pre. Approximate timestamps may be requested in the case that it would  &#170;
&#170;     assist in the verification that the source sample provided is the       &#170;
&#170;     source used for encode (e.g. include.banner.at.4m13s). The group has 24 &#170;
&#170;     hours from the nuke to pre a RARed SOURCE.SAMPLE that is at least 10    &#170;
&#170;     seconds in length in order to document that the source is valid.        &#170;
&#170;     Failure to provide source proof or providing bad source proof shall     &#170;
&#170;     result in the release remaining nuked, and it may then be propered.     &#170;
&#170;   - Improper IVTC methods that result in jerky playback, such as Force      &#170;
&#170;     Film, are banned                                                        &#170;
&#170;   - Interlaced video sources must be deinterlaced with a smart deinterlacer &#170;
&#170;     such as Yadif. FieldDeinterlace is banned.                              &#170;
&#170;   - Group watermarks of any kind on the video are banned                    &#170;
&#170;   - Intros, outros, betweenos, or any other form of defacement of the       &#170;
&#170;     episode are banned                                                      &#170;
&#170;   - &#34;Native&#34; refers to the standard in which the video was produced (e.g.   &#170;
&#170;     NTSC or PAL). NTSC produced video is native to NTSC, PAL produced video &#170;
&#170;     is native to PAL. PAL produced video that is broadcast in NTSC is       &#170;
&#170;     converted. NTSC produced video that is broadcast in PAL is converted.   &#170;
&#170;   - Converted video that has significant artifacting (e.g. blended frames)  &#170;
&#170;     and cannot be reversed to native must use CONVERT tag                   &#170;
&#170;   - Converted video that does not have significant artifacts does not need  &#170;
&#170;     convert tags and may not be nuked for the conversion                    &#170;
&#170;   - Native releases are allowed after those tagged CONVERT. Use NATIVE tag. &#170;
&#170;                                                                             &#170;
&#170;  Audio:                                                                     &#170;
&#170;   - Allowed audio formats are VBR AAC LC (Low Complexity).                  &#170;
&#170;   - Average bitrate on AAC audio must be 96 - 160 kbps.                     &#170;
&#170;   - AAC audio must be normalized and downconverted to stereo.               &#170;
&#170;   - Nero and Apple encoders are recommended. FFmpeg and FAAC are banned.    &#170;
&#170;   - Multiple language audio tracks are allowed and must be listed in NFO    &#170;
&#170;   - Severe audio drops resulting in one full missing word or otherwise the  &#170;
&#170;     inability to  understand material dialogue is considered to be a        &#170;
&#170;     technical flaw and may be propered                                      &#170;
&#170;   - Audio that is 120ms or more out of sync or drifts more than 120ms       &#170;
&#170;     between any two points (e.g. needing -80 at one and +40 at another) is  &#170;
&#170;     considered to be technically flawed and may be propered                 &#170;
&#170;                                                                             &#170;
&#170;  Framerate:                                                                 &#170;
&#170;   - Framerate must be constant. Variable framerate is banned.               &#170;
&#170;   - IVTC or deinterlacing must be applied as needed                         &#170;
&#170;   - 50/60fps video may be released at 50/60fps or 25/30fps. Releasing true  &#170;
&#170;     25/30fps video at 50/60 is considered a technical flaw.                 &#170;
&#170;   - In rare cases, 25/50Hz sources should be IVTC&#39;d to 24 or 30 fps.        &#170;
&#170;   - In rare cases, 30/60Hz sources should be IVTC&#39;d to 25fps.               &#170;
&#170;     Failure to apply IVTC when needed is a technical flaw.                  &#170;
&#170;                                                                             &#170;

&#170;   - Video codec must be H264 encoded with 8-bit depth x264.                 &#170;
&#170;   - You will have 30 days from latest  x264  rev date to update in order to &#170;
&#170;     maintain all bug fixes and improvements in the x264 encoder.            &#170;
&#170;   - Stripping or falsifying encode information in the file header is banned &#170;
&#170;   - Custom Matrices are allowed                                             &#170;

&#170;   - Deblocking  must  be  used;  values are at the discretion of the group. &#170;
&#170;     (default is enabled, 0:0 settings)                                      &#170;
&#170;   - No setting can go below what is specified by --preset slow.             &#170;
&#170;   - Keyframe  interval  (--keyint) must be at least 200 and at most 300. It &#170;
&#170;     is  recommended  to  be  10*framerate  (film=240,  PAL=250,  NTSC=300). &#170;
&#170;   - Minkeyint must be 30 or less                                            &#170;
&#170;   - Colormatrix must be set to source specification. If not specified by    &#170;
&#170;     source, bt709 must be used for sources with resolution greater than or  &#170;
&#170;     equal to 1280x720 (e.g. HDTV and some PDTV) and sources with lower      &#170;
&#170;     resolutions use &#39;undef&#39; (default).                                      &#170;

&#170;   - Zones (--zones) are forbidden.                                          &#170;
&#170;   - Any deviation in CRF from given examples must be specifically justified &#170;
&#170;     in the NFO. Use discretion when deviating CRF by matching the           &#170;
&#170;     compressibility of the show to a corresponding CRF value. CRF values    &#170;
&#170;     below 19 and above 24 are never permitted.                              &#170;
&#170;   - As a general suggestion, average video bitrate in excess of 1500kb/s    &#170;
&#170;     is a sign that a higher CRF value should be chosen, when possible       &#170;
&#170;   - Allowed parameters for --tune (optional) are film/grain/animation       &#170;
&#170;   - Level 3.1 must be respected.                                            &#170;

&#170;   - Custom muxing tools are permitted; however, output must be compatible   &#170;
&#170;     with standard demuxers to the same extent that files created with       &#170;
&#170;     MP4Box are.                                                             &#170;

&#170;     - 720p/1080i/1080p shall be tagged HDTV or AHDTV (depending on capture  &#170;
&#170;       method). In the case of upscaled content airing on HD channel, use    &#170;
&#170;       PDTV tag.                                                             &#170;

&#170;     component, DVI, HDMI) must be tagged in dirname as AHDTV. Decoded       &#170;
&#170;     output of PDTV or DSR sources is banned. Releases taken from a natively &#170;
&#170;     recorded transport stream shall be tagged as HDTV, PDTV, or DSR.        &#170;
&#170;     - AHDTV captures must be done at the native format of the channel, e.g. &#170;
&#170;       720p or 1080i.                                                        &#170;

&#170;   - PDTV sources with horizontal source resolution of 720-704px after crop  &#170;
&#170;     must be cropped as needed and only height shall be resized to maintain  &#170;
&#170;     proper AR using mod2. Upscaling/downscaling width is forbidden.         &#170;
&#170;   - PDTV sources with horizontal source resolution of less than 704px after &#170;
&#170;     crop must be cropped as needed and resized to fit within 704x528 while  &#170;
&#170;     maintaining the proper AR using mod2. Largest possible resolution must  &#170;

&#170;   - Different shows with the same name in the same country produced in      &#170;
&#170;     different years must have the year of the first season in the directory &#170;
&#170;     name, e.g. Human.Target.2010 and Doctor.Who.2005. Year is not needed    &#170;
