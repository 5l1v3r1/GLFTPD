    <pre class="nfo">PDA Trainer rules:  (Updated: Aug 2005)
---------------------------------------

Naming:

Folder names:
For Trainers naming should be:
Game.Version.Plus.X.Trainer.OS-Group
example:
Mario.v1.0.Plus.3.Trainer.PalmOS-FooBar

For cheats/guides naming should be:
Game.Version.Type.OS-Group
example:
Mario.v1.0.Cheats.PalmOS-FooBar

Allowed types are:
- Cheats
- Walkthrough
- Guide

Allowed OS: same as PDA rules, if PDA rules change, so does this.
Allowed Group name:  same as PDA rules if PDA rules change, so does this.

All file names MUST follow 8.3 rule.

If a trainer is already released, a trainer with more cheats is allowed. A group is only allowed to release ONE trainer for each game version (if group X releases +3 and group Y release +4, group X can NOT release +5 unless as stated that the version has changed).

If a game is released with more than one version (lowres and highres), the trainer-release must include trainers with equal functionality for all these versions

Trainers/Cheats for games that have not been release on the scene is NOT allowed. The scene release can not be more than 4 months old.


Trainers MUST:
... Work on both cracked/uncracked version


Trainers MUST NOT:
... Be bigger than 100k bytes
... Bundle the game
... Cracks the game.
... Require better PDA than the game


Cheats MUST NOT:
... Be stolen from anywere (you have to hack them out yourself)


IMPORTANT INFO TO SITEOPs : 

... As we have seen in the past, there are some rules which prevent groups releases being nuked on an affiliate site.  We think that if a valid nuke reason applies to any release, it should be nuked on all sites - affil or not.

                ->>> AFFIL PREVENTS NOT FROM BEEING NUKED !!! &#60;&#60;&#60;-

                                    RULES SIGNED BY
                                   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
