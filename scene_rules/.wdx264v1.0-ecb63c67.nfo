&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; [ Intro ]                                                                   &#9474;
&#9474; In the last 18 months, web based streaming and video on-demand services     &#9474;
&#9474; have increased in popularity. Initially used as a source for missed         &#9474;
&#9474; broadcasts, it has since evolved into an exclusive source for original      &#9474;
&#9474; content. Like most technology, online services are continually evolving     &#9474;
&#9474; the way in which files re provided to end users. As codecs mature,          &#9474;
&#9474; bandwidth increases in speed and decreases in price, equivalent             &#9474;
&#9474; improvements in quality follows at the benefit to the end-users. This       &#9474;
&#9474; increase in quality has the flow-on effect of often being a legitimate      &#9474;
&#9474; logo-free alternative to antiquated MPEG-2 HDTV streams. As companies       &#9474;
&#9474; such as Netflix and Amazon continue to produce popular content at an        &#9474;
&#9474; exponential rate, it became obvious that this new broadcast medium          &#9474;
&#9474; deserved to be recognised with an original ruleset.                         &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; The purpose of this document is to create a high standard for web-sourced   &#9474;
&#9474; files. It attempts to prevent any improper handling of files, and reduce    &#9474;
&#9474; the potential for adding to the increasing number of ongoing nuke-wars.     &#9474;
&#9474; This ruleset is structured in such a way that everything attempts to be     &#9474;
&#9474; clear and concise, and something everyone must adhere to.                   &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; Compliance with this document is optional as of its pre date, and           &#9474;
&#9474; mandatory as of 2016-03-21 00:00:00 UTC (1458518400 Unix time).             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9500;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9508;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 1) [ Untouched: WEB.H264 / WEB.x264 ]                                       &#9474;
&#9474;  1.1) Untouched releases must be considered as anything that has been       &#9474;
&#9474;       losslessly downloaded by official (offered) or unofficial (backdoor)  &#9474;
&#9474;       methods.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;   1.1.1) Untouched video streams must use a commercial (e.g. CoreAVC,       &#9474;
&#9474;          MainConcept) or GPL-licensed (e.g. x264, x265) H.264/MPEG-4 AVC    &#9474;
&#9474;          or H.265/HEVC codec.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;  1.2) Source video and audio streams must be left as obtained from the      &#9474;
&#9474;       source. Transcoding of audio or video streams is not allowed.         &#9474;
&#9474;  1.3) Untouched video streams without x264 headers must be tagged as        &#9474;
&#9474;       WEB.H264. Untouched video streams with x264 headers present in the    &#9474;
&#9474;       H264 stream must be tagged as WEB.x264.                               &#9474;
&#9474;   1.3.1) In situations where HEVC/H265 is used, any untouched sections      &#9474;
&#9474;          referring to H264/x264 must be considered as H265/x265.            &#9474;
&#9474;    1.3.1.1) H265 must be used in place of H264.                             &#9474;
&#9474;    1.3.1.2) x265 must be used in place of x264.                             &#9474;
&#9474;   1.3.2) Until H265/x265 support is improved in mainstream demuxers,        &#9474;
&#9474;          untouched video streams which use H265/x265 do not dupe H264/x264  &#9474;
&#9474;          files, and vice-versa.                                             &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. WEB.H265 does not dupe WEB.H264                              &#9474;
&#9474;                WEB.x264 does not dupe WEB.x265.                             &#9474;
&#9474;  1.4) Transcoding untouched files must only occur if files do not meet the  &#9474;
&#9474;       standards and specifications listed in this section, and must only    &#9474;
&#9474;       be a last resort.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   1.4.1) Any transcoding of untouched files must follow the transcoding     &#9474;
&#9474;          standards, see section 2.                                          &#9474;
&#9474;   1.4.2) Transcoding must be done from files of the highest resolution and  &#9474;
&#9474;          bitrate offered.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   1.4.3) Transcoding may occur when correcting a technical flaw.            &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. Cropping black borders, deinterlacing an interlaced source.  &#9474;
&#9474;   1.4.4) In situations where a target resolution is not offered by any      &#9474;
&#9474;          lossless source, or the resolution offered by any source does not  &#9474;
&#9474;          meet the minimum resolution requirements, transcoding from the     &#9474;
&#9474;          highest resolution and bitrate offered is allowed. However, if at  &#9474;
&#9474;          least one source can provide the correct resolution, transcoding   &#9474;
&#9474;          is not allowed.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. If 1080p and 720p can be retrieved from multiple sources,    &#9474;
&#9474;                but SD cannot be retrieved from any source, transcoding the  &#9474;
&#9474;                1080p to SD is allowed.                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   1.4.5) If the untouched file does not contain any technical flaws and     &#9474;
&#9474;          meets the minimum standards required, transcoding to create any    &#9474;
&#9474;          WEBRip.x264 is not allowed, use INTERNAL.                          &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. 1080p.WEB.H264 -> 720p.WEBRip.x264.                          &#9474;
&#9474;  1.5) Untouched video streams which do not use an AVC or HEVC codec must be &#9474;
&#9474;       transcoded and follow the transcoding standards, see section 3.       &#9474;
&#9474;  1.6) Standard definition (SD) refers to a resolution with a horizontal     &#9474;
&#9474;       minimum of 720 pixels or a resolution which does not exceed the       &#9474;
&#9474;       specifications of 720p, see rule 6.2.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   1.6.1) If all sources provide standard definition resolutions which fall  &#9474;
&#9474;          below the above minimum, transcoding from the highest available    &#9474;
&#9474;          resolution is allowed, see rule 1.4.4.                             &#9474;
&#9474;   1.6.2) Except in situations where only one source has the file on offer   &#9474;
&#9474;          at a specific resolution. If the resolution of the file falls      &#9474;
&#9474;          below the above minimum, the file may still be released, but the   &#9474;
&#9474;          NFO must state why the resolution does not meet the minimum.       &#9474;
&#9474;  1.7) DRM and any user identifiable information must be removed.            &#9474;
&#9474;  1.8) Dupes based on source are not allowed, use INTERNAL.                  &#9474;
&#9474;  1.9) YouTube may only be used as a source if geographical restrictions     &#9474;
&#9474;       apply to legitimate content uploaded by the rights holder or on a     &#9474;
&#9474;       verified channel.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;  1.10) Must use the highest available bitrate offered by the source for     &#9474;
&#9474;        that resolution.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. Releasing a 720p at 4,000 Kbps bitrate, when a 720p at         &#9474;
&#9474;              8,000 Kbps bitrate is offered is not allowed.                  &#9474;
&#9474;  1.11) Must be free of technical flaws. Including, but not limited to: DRM, &#9474;
&#9474;        sync issues, interlaced, lack of IVTC, bad AR, missing footage,      &#9474;
&#9474;        missing dialogue, unrelated footage or commercials, under or over    &#9474;
&#9474;        crop.                                                                &#9474;
&#9474;  1.12) VFR (Variable Frame Rate) methods are allowed only if present in the &#9474;
&#9474;        original source.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   1.12.1) If CFR (Constant Frame Rate) can be used when remuxing and does   &#9474;
&#9474;           not result in playback issue, CFR must be used.                   &#9474;
&#9474;  1.13) Trimming unrelated footage (section 8) is allowed and must be done   &#9474;
&#9474;        losslessly via keyframe intervals (GOP). MKVToolnix is the           &#9474;
&#9474;        recommended tool.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   1.13.1) If unrelated footage cannot be removed via this method, the file  &#9474;
&#9474;           must be transcoded and follow the transcoding standards, see      &#9474;
&#9474;           section 3.                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;  1.14) Incorrect pixel aspect ratio (PAR) or a non-square sample aspect     &#9474;
&#9474;        ratio (SAR) must be fixed using the correct display aspect ratio     &#9474;
&#9474;        (DAR) set at a container level (--aspect-ratio). MKVToolnix is the   &#9474;
&#9474;        recommended tool.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. A video stream with a non-square SAR must specify the correct  &#9474;
&#9474;              DAR when muxing.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;  1.15) Releases with a non-square SAR are not considered technically        &#9474;
&#9474;        flawed.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;   1.15.1) However, a source which provides files with a square SAR will     &#9474;
&#9474;           trump an equivalent file with a non-square SAR. It is recommended &#9474;
&#9474;           to use a source which provides files with a square SAR.           &#9474;
&#9474;   1.15.2) In situations where a source initially provides a non-square SAR  &#9474;
&#9474;           file and later updates with a square SAR file, the initial        &#9474;
&#9474;           release with a non-square SAR is considered of lower quality      &#9474;
&#9474;           and a technical flaw.                                             &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. Release A: 960x720, SAR: 4:3, DAR: 16:9.                    &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release B: 1280x720, SAR: 1:1, DAR: 16:9.                   &#9474;
&#9474;                 Both releases are considered as 720p.                       &#9474;
&#9474;                 If Release A is first: Release A remains unnuked and is a   &#9474;
&#9474;                 valid release until Release B is released. Release B then   &#9474;
&#9474;                 propers Release A.                                          &#9474;
&#9474;                 If Release B is first: Release A dupes Release B.           &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 2) [ Untouched: Audio ]                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;  2.1) Must use the original audio track offered by the source.              &#9474;
&#9474;  2.2) Non-destructive audio normalisation tools such as ReplayGain may be   &#9474;
&#9474;       used, and must be done to the maximum gain. Audio normalisation on    &#9474;
&#9474;       lossy tracks is optional.                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  2.3) Standard definition releases must only contain an audio track with a  &#9474;
&#9474;       maximum of 2.0 channels.                                              &#9474;
&#9474;   2.3.1) Except where the only available audio track on offer contains more &#9474;
&#9474;          than 2.0 channels. The NFO must mention why an audio track with    &#9474;
&#9474;          more than 2.0 channels was used.                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   2.3.2) In situations where a source provides two audio tracks, a 2.0 and  &#9474;
&#9474;          5.1 track, the 2.0 audio track must be used.                       &#9474;
&#9474;   2.3.3) If a source provides identical audio tracks using two different    &#9474;
&#9474;          codecs, it is at the discretion of the group which track is used.  &#9474;
&#9474;          It is recommended to use the smaller file.                         &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. A source offers AC3 2.0 and AAC 2.0, the group may choose to &#9474;
&#9474;                remux the AC3 or AAC.                                        &#9474;
&#9474;  2.4) High Definition releases must use the highest available audio format  &#9474;
&#9474;       and quality offered by the source.                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   2.4.1) In situations where a lesser audio format is offered for larger    &#9474;
&#9474;          resolutions in comparison to lower resolutions, groups must use    &#9474;
&#9474;          the highest available audio format from all resolutions.           &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. A source provides an AC3 5.1 track for SD resolutions, but   &#9474;
&#9474;                an AAC 2.0 track for 720p/1080p. The AC3 5.1 track must be   &#9474;
&#9474;                used for 720p/1080p resolutions.                             &#9474;
&#9474;   2.4.2) If using the highest available audio format results in a technical &#9474;
&#9474;          flaw (e.g. sync issues or glitches), minor adjustments to the      &#9474;
&#9474;          audio track may be applied. If groups are unable to correct any    &#9474;
&#9474;          flaws, the original audio track must be used.                      &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 3) [ Transcoded: WEBRip.x264 ]                                              &#9474;
&#9474;  3.1) Transcoded releases should be considered as anything that has been    &#9474;
&#9474;       captured or encoded by a group to a lesser format or quality (lossy). &#9474;
&#9474;  3.2) Transcoded releases must be tagged as WEBRip.x264.                    &#9474;
&#9474;  3.3) Dupes based on source are not allowed, use INTERNAL.                  &#9474;
&#9474;  3.4) Must be free of technical flaws. Including, but not limited to: DRM,  &#9474;
&#9474;       sync issues, interlaced, lack of IVTC, bad AR, missing footage,       &#9474;
&#9474;       missing dialogue, unrelated footage or commercials, under or over     &#9474;
&#9474;       crop, dupe or dropped frames.                                         &#9474;
&#9474;  3.5) Upscaling video streams is not allowed.                               &#9474;
&#9474;        e.g. 2160p from a 1080p stream is not allowed.                       &#9474;
&#9474;  3.6) Streams must be captured at the highest available resolution and      &#9474;
&#9474;       bitrate offered.                                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   3.6.1) Streams must not have any degradation in quality throughout the    &#9474;
&#9474;          capture, and releases with drops to a lower resolution or bitrate  &#9474;
&#9474;          is considered a technical flaw.                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   3.6.2) 1080p and 2160p streams are considered of equal value when         &#9474;
&#9474;          capturing, and encodes (SD/720p/1080p) produced from 1080p or      &#9474;
&#9474;          2160p captures are considered identical. It is encouraged, and     &#9474;
&#9474;          recommended, to capture from a 2160p stream where possible and     &#9474;
&#9474;          resize so as to produce a higher quality encode.                   &#9474;
&#9474;   3.6.3) Audio must be captured in the highest format offered by the source &#9474;
&#9474;          stream, not what the capturing device is capable of. This includes &#9474;
&#9474;          channel count and bitrate offered.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. If a Netflix show lists a 5.1 track, the resultant capture   &#9474;
&#9474;                and release should also contain a 5.1 audio track.           &#9474;
&#9474;  3.7) Captures should be done at the native broadcast framerate of the      &#9474;
&#9474;       source.                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   3.7.1) Captures from devices which are unable to output a native format   &#9474;
&#9474;          must be restored to the original framerate.                        &#9474;
&#9474;   3.7.2) If captures cannot be completely restored to their native          &#9474;
&#9474;          framerate, such as a single dupe frame every 1000 or blended/ghost &#9474;
&#9474;          frames due to mangling from the streaming device, this is          &#9474;
&#9474;          considered a technical flaw.                                       &#9474;
&#9474;  3.8) Captures should be done at the native colour space of the source      &#9474;
&#9474;       (e.g. YUV or RGB), and manual corrections should be made to achieve   &#9474;
&#9474;       an output near-identical to the source.                               &#9474;
&#9474;  3.9) Capture software and hardware which introduces video cropping greater &#9474;
&#9474;       than 2 pixels on any side is not allowed, and is considered a         &#9474;
&#9474;       technical flaw.                                                       &#9474;
&#9474;  3.10) Final resolution must maintain the same aspect ratio as the source   &#9474;
&#9474;        after cropping and kept at mod 2.                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   3.10.1) Sources must have all black borders cropped to the widest frame.  &#9474;
&#9474;   3.10.2) The same aspect ratio, as calculated from the source, must be     &#9474;
&#9474;           used, see rule 6.17.                                              &#9474;
&#9474;  3.11) If the video is being transcoded from an untouched source (rule      &#9474;
&#9474;        1.4.4 and 1.4.5), the NFO must state the reason for transcoding.     &#9474;
&#9474;   3.11.1) If a technical flaw is present that is being rectified by         &#9474;
&#9474;           transcoding (rule 1.4.5), the flaw must also be included with the &#9474;
&#9474;           reason for transcoding.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. A file from 2 lossless providers both have the same         &#9474;
&#9474;                 interlacing flaw.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;                 The flaw: Interlaced video.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;                 The reason: No other WEB.H264 provider has a correctly      &#9474;
&#9474;                 deinterlaced file.                                          &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;   4.1.1) Custom builds of x264 are allowed and must be based off the x264   &#9474;
&#9474;          codebase, e.g. x264-tMod, x264-kMod.                               &#9474;
&#9474;   4.1.2) Any experimental or alternate codecs (e.g. x265) are not allowed,  &#9474;
&#9474;          use INTERNAL.                                                      &#9474;
&#9474;  4.2) x264 revision must be no more than 50 revisions from the latest at    &#9474;
&#9474;       pre time. It is recommended to use the latest revision when encoding. &#9474;
&#9474;       Use the official x264 git repo as the only                            &#9474;
&#9474;       reference: http://git.videolan.org/?p=x264.git;a=summary              &#9474;
&#9474;  4.3) Segmented encoding is not allowed.                                    &#9474;
&#9474;  4.4) Justification must be listed in the NFO for use of non-standard CRF   &#9474;
&#9474;       values.                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;  4.5) Decimal values may be used for CRF values.                            &#9474;
&#9474;  4.6) Constant Rate Factor (--crf) must be used by default.                 &#9474;
&#9474;   4.6.1) A CRF value of 19 must be used for all SD resolutions.             &#9474;
&#9474;    4.6.1.1) If the resultant video bitrate exceeds 2,000 Kbps, the CRF      &#9474;
&#9474;             value must be incremented by 1.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;    4.6.1.2) If the resultant video bitrate exceeds 1,500 Kbps, the CRF      &#9474;
&#9474;             value may be optionally incremented by up to 1.0, e.g. 19.2,    &#9474;
&#9474;             19.6.                                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   4.6.2) A CRF value of 18 must be used for all 720p resolutions.           &#9474;
&#9474;    4.6.2.1) If the resultant video bitrate exceeds 9,000 Kbps, the CRF      &#9474;
&#9474;             value must be incremented by 1.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;    4.6.2.2) If the resultant video bitrate exceeds 8,000 Kbps, the CRF      &#9474;
&#9474;             value may be optionally incremented by up to 1.0, e.g. 18.2,    &#9474;
&#9474;             18.6.                                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   4.6.3) A CRF value of 17 must be used for all 1080p resolutions.          &#9474;
&#9474;    4.6.3.1) If the resultant video bitrate exceeds 15,000 Kbps, the CRF     &#9474;
&#9474;             value must be incremented by 1.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;    4.6.3.2) If the resultant video bitrate exceeds 14,000 Kbps, the CRF     &#9474;
&#9474;             value may be optionally incremented by up to 1.0, e.g. 17.2,    &#9474;
&#9474;             17.6.                                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   4.6.4) A CRF value of 17 must be used for all 2160p resolutions.          &#9474;
&#9474;  4.7) Use of 2-pass is accepted for all resolutions of 720p and above,      &#9474;
&#9474;       however this method should be used only in extreme cases and not as   &#9474;
&#9474;       a primary replacement for CRF methods. e.g. If the source contains an &#9474;
&#9474;       excessive amount of grain or black and white scenes.                  &#9474;
&#9474;   4.7.1) 2-pass should be a last resort when encoding. Instead, groups are  &#9474;
&#9474;          encouraged and recommended to use CRF as the default encoding      &#9474;
&#9474;          method.                                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   4.7.2) The NFO must provide sufficient evidence of 2-pass producing a     &#9474;
&#9474;          visual improvement, bitrate, or file size advantage over CRF in    &#9474;
&#9474;          regards to the source used.                                        &#9474;
&#9474;   4.7.3) There is no maximum or minimum file size when using 2-pass methods &#9474;
&#9474;          as target bitrates should take precedent over target file sizes.   &#9474;
&#9474;          Multiples of 1120MiB (1,174,405,120 bytes) may be used as a        &#9474;
&#9474;          general guide for calculating target bitrates.                     &#9474;
&#9474;   4.7.4) If groups are unsure of how to calculate an adequate target        &#9474;
&#9474;          bitrate applicable for the source, CRF should be used.             &#9474;
&#9474;    4.7.4.1) 720p bitrate must be between 4,000 Kbps and 9,000 Kbps          &#9474;
&#9474;             inclusive, and should have a target bitrate of approximately    &#9474;
&#9474;             5,500 Kbps. Minimum bitrate for animation is 2,500 Kbps.        &#9474;
&#9474;    4.7.4.2) 1080p bitrate must be between 9,000 Kbps and 15,000 Kbps        &#9474;
&#9474;             inclusive, and should have a target bitrate of approximately    &#9474;
&#9474;             10,500 Kbps. Minimum bitrate for animation is 5,500 Kbps.       &#9474;
&#9474;    4.7.4.3) 2160p bitrate must not exceed 60,000 Kbps.                      &#9474;
&#9474;  4.8) Resultant bitrate must not exceed the source bitrate.                 &#9474;
&#9474;   4.8.1) When transcoding from an untouched source, it is recommended to    &#9474;
&#9474;          use SelectRangeEvery() for a rough estimation on the final CRF     &#9474;
&#9474;          value to use.                                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   4.8.2) The following algorithm can also be used to estimate a CRF value   &#9474;
&#9474;          if the value originally used results in a bitrate which exceeds    &#9474;
&#9474;          the source.                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;           ValidCRF = [-6 * (DestinationBitrate - ExcessiveBitrate) /        &#9474;
&#9474;                      ExcessiveBitrate] + CRFUsed                            &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. Source bitrate: 4,500Kbps                                   &#9474;
&#9474;              Target bitrate: ~4,400Kbps                                     &#9474;
&#9474;              Encoded bitrate @ CRF17: 5,900Kbps                             &#9474;
&#9474;              ValidCRF = (-6 * (4400 - 5900) / 5900) + 17                    &#9474;
&#9474;              ValidCRF = 18.52, round up to 19 should result in an average   &#9474;
&#9474;              bitrate below the source.                                      &#9474;
&#9474;  4.9) Settings cannot go below what is specified by --preset slow.          &#9474;
&#9474;        e.g. -subme 7 or -me hex is not allowed.                             &#9474;
&#9474;  4.10) Deblocking (--deblock) must be used. Values used are left to the     &#9474;
&#9474;        discretion of the group. Recommended values: -3:-3 for film, 1:1     &#9474;
&#9474;        for animation.                                                       &#9474;
&#9474;  4.11) Sample Aspect Ratio (--sar) must be square (1:1).                    &#9474;
&#9474;  4.12) Keyframe interval (--keyint) must be at least 200, and at most 300.  &#9474;
&#9474;        It is recommended to let x264 decide which value to use, but         &#9474;
&#9474;        10*framerate is a good guideline.                                    &#9474;
&#9474;  4.13) Minimum GOP length (--minkeyint) must be 30 or less.                 &#9474;

&#9474;   6.9.2) Releases which contain an additional 20 pixels or more worth of    &#9474;
&#9474;          video on any side are not considered dupes. These releases must be &#9474;
&#9474;          tagged as WS or OM (open matte) and not PROPER, and the original   &#9474;
&#9474;          release must not be nuked.                                         &#9474;
&#9474;  6.10) Retention or removal of faded edges is left to the discretion of the &#9474;
&#9474;        group. Inclusion of faded edges is not a technical flaw, and cannot  &#9474;
&#9474;        be propered.                                                         &#9474;
&#9474;   6.10.1) Faded edges refer to a line of pixels which are of similar        &#9474;
&#9474;           appearance to pixels&#39; parallel to the video frame.                &#9474;
&#9474;  6.11) Black borders and anything that is not part of the video must be     &#9474;
&#9474;        cropped.                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   6.11.1) Black borders refer to: black or coloured borders, duplicate      &#9474;
&#9474;           lines, dirty lines or pixels.                                     &#9474;
&#9474;  6.12) Video can be over or under cropped by a maximum of 1px per side.     &#9474;
&#9474;        Over or under cropping by more than 1px per side is considered a     &#9474;
&#9474;        technical flaw.                                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   6.12.1) Under crop refers to portions of the video frame which is not     &#9474;
&#9474;           actual picture. Files which contain black borders greater than    &#9474;
&#9474;           1px on any side is considered a technical flaw.                   &#9474;
&#9474;   6.12.2) Releases which include faded edges must consider faded edges as   &#9474;
&#9474;           a valid part of the video frame and do not count as black         &#9474;
&#9474;           borders.                                                          &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. A release cannot be propered if 1px of faded edges and 1px  &#9474;
&#9474;                 of black exists.                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   6.12.3) Situations where video cropping of the same content varies        &#9474;
&#9474;           between sources are not considered a technical flaw, and may      &#9474;
&#9474;           not be propered.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;  6.13) In the case of varying aspect ratios throughout the video, cropping  &#9474;
&#9474;        must be done to the widest video frame.                              &#9474;
&#9474;   6.13.1) Studio logos, intertitles, and credits must be disregarded when   &#9474;
&#9474;           determining the widest frame.                                     &#9474;
&#9474;  6.14) Any sort of visual glitch present in the video stream is considered  &#9474;
&#9474;        a technical flaw.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   6.14.1) Except in situations where glitches are a result of a live-stream &#9474;
&#9474;           or issues with the broadcast or source and are completely         &#9474;
&#9474;           unavoidable. It is recommended, but optional, to mention glitches &#9474;
&#9474;           or gaps in playback in the NFO.                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   6.14.2) Unavoidable glitches as a result of broadcast, live-stream, or    &#9474;
&#9474;           mastering issues may be propered with a glitch-free version.      &#9474;
&#9474;   6.14.3) Visual glitches are defined as, but not limited to:               &#9474;
&#9474;           visual/compression artifacts, signal/stream issues, missing       &#9474;
&#9474;           frames.                                                           &#9474;
&#9474;  6.15) Resized and transcoded video must be within 0.5% of the original     &#9474;
&#9474;        aspect ratio.                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;  6.16) Sample aspect ratio (SAR):                                           &#9474;
&#9474;        SAR = (PixelHeight / PixelWidth) / (DARHeight / DARWidth)            &#9474;
&#9474;  6.17) Display aspect ratio (DAR):                                          &#9474;
&#9474;        DAR = (PixelWidth * DARWidth) / (PixelHeight * DARHeight)            &#9474;
&#9474;  6.18) Display resolution:                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;        DisplayWidth = PixelWidth * (SARWidth / SARHeight)                   &#9474;
&#9474;  6.19) Aspect ratio (AR) error:                                             &#9474;
&#9474;        Original AR = (SourceWidth - [CropLeft + CropRight]) /               &#9474;
&#9474;                      (SourceHeight - [CropTop + CropBottom])                &#9474;
&#9474;        Release AR = EncodeWidth / EncodedHeight                             &#9474;
&#9474;        AR Error % = [(Original AR - Release AR) / Original AR] * 100        &#9474;
&#9474;  6.20) Target resolution when resizing to maintain mod2 and reduce AR       &#9474;
&#9474;        error:                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;        TargetHeight = TargetWidth / [(SourceWidth -                         &#9474;
&#9474;                       [CropLeft + CropRight]) / (SourceHeight -             &#9474;
&#9474;                       [CropTop + CropBottom])]                              &#9474;
&#9474;        The correct mod 2 value can also be calculated from the ceiling of   &#9474;
&#9474;        TargetHeight if the value is odd, and the floor of TargetHeight if   &#9474;
&#9474;        the value is even.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;  6.20.1) Alternatively, the following can be used to confirm the correct    &#9474;
&#9474;          resolution is used from the above method by calculating the upper  &#9474;
&#9474;          and lower integer limit of TargetHeight:                           &#9474;
&#9474;          HeightA = floor(TargetHeight + [TargetHeight mod 2])               &#9474;
&#9474;          HeightB = floor(TargetHeight - [TargetHeight mod 2])               &#9474;
&#9474;          The TargetHeight value (HeightA or HeightB) which results in an    &#9474;
&#9474;          aspect ratio error which tends to zero must be used.               &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. TargetWidth: 1280.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;                SourceWidth: 1920, SourceHeight: 1080.                       &#9474;
&#9474;                CropLeft + CropRight = 0, CropTop + CropBottom = 4.          &#9474;
&#9474;                TargetHeight = 1280 / ((1920 - 0) / (1080 - 4)) or 717.33.   &#9474;
&#9474;                HeightA = floor(717.33 + (717.33 mod 2)) or 718.             &#9474;
&#9474;                HeightB = floor(717.33 - (717.33 mod 2)) or 716.             &#9474;
&#9474;                TargetWidth x HeightA = 1280x718 with -0.09% AR error.       &#9474;
&#9474;                TargetWidth x HeightB = 1280x716 with 0.19% AR error.        &#9474;
&#9474;                -0.09% tends closer to zero than 0.19% does (0.09 &#60; 0.19),   &#9474;
&#9474;                therefore, HeightA must be used.                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 7) [ Framerate / Filters ]                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;  7.1) IVTC, deinterlacing, or decimation must be applied as required.       &#9474;
&#9474;  7.2) Only smart deinterlacers, such as Yadif, QTGMC, or TFM, must be used. &#9474;
&#9474;   7.2.1) FieldDeinterlace must not be used for deinterlacing.               &#9474;
&#9474;  7.3) Only accurate field matching filters, such as TIVTC or Decomb, must   &#9474;
&#9474;       be used for inverse telecining (IVTC).                                &#9474;
&#9474;   7.3.1) Use of MEncoder, MJPEG tools, libav, libavcodec, or FFmpeg as IVTC &#9474;
&#9474;          filters are not allowed.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   7.3.2) Deinterlacing filters must not be applied to telecined sources as  &#9474;
&#9474;          a method of inverse telecine. Use of an accurate field matching    &#9474;
&#9474;          filter must be used on telecined sources to recreate progressive   &#9474;
&#9474;          frames and must be decimated to remove any duplicate frames.       &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. Yadif must not be used on a telecined source with a frame    &#9474;
&#9474;                sequence of PPIIP, as Yadif will attempt to deinterlace      &#9474;
&#9474;                every frame, including the progressive frames. TFM and       &#9474;
&#9474;                TDecimate should be used in this situation.                  &#9474;
&#9474;  7.4) Only sharp resizers are allowed. Simple resizers such as bicubic,     &#9474;
&#9474;       simple, etc, are not allowed. Only the following resizers are allowed &#9474;
&#9474;       (in order of preference):                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   7.4.1) Spline36Resize/Spline64Resize.                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   7.4.2) BlackmanResize.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   7.4.3) LanczosResize/Lanczos4Resize.                                      &#9474;
&#9474;  7.5) Sources which contain footage at varying FPS throughout (hybrid       &#9474;
&#9474;       sources) and may or may not require IVTC is left to the discretion    &#9474;
&#9474;       of the group. The NFO must list a reason as to the final decision.    &#9474;
&#9474;   7.5.1) It is assumed that the majority of a title contains enough unique  &#9474;
&#9474;          frames at 30,000/1,001 fps to warrant a higher framerate. If it    &#9474;
&#9474;          can be proven IVTC/decimating does not result in any loss of       &#9474;
&#9474;          unique frames, this is considered a technical flaw.                &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. The native format of a Netflix title is 30,000/1,001 fps but &#9474;
&#9474;                contains some footage filmed at 24,000/1,001 fps. Choosing   &#9474;
&#9474;                to encode the entire release at 30,000/1,001 fps is valid.   &#9474;
&#9474;  7.6) Native and converted framerates refers to the standard in which the   &#9474;
&#9474;       video was produced.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   7.6.1) NTSC produced video is native to NTSC.                             &#9474;
&#9474;   7.6.2) PAL produced video is native to PAL.                               &#9474;
&#9474;   7.6.3) NTSC produced video that is broadcast in PAL is considered as      &#9474;
&#9474;          converted video.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   7.6.4) PAL produced video that is broadcast in NTSC is considered as      &#9474;
&#9474;          converted video.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;  7.7) Converted video that has significant artifacts (e.g. blended frames)  &#9474;
&#9474;       and cannot be reversed to the native format must be tagged as         &#9474;
&#9474;       CONVERT.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;   7.7.1) Converted video which does not have any artifacts does not require &#9474;
&#9474;          the CONVERT tag and must not be nuked for the conversion.          &#9474;
&#9474;  7.8) 50 / 60 fps video may be released at 50 / 60 fps or 25 / 30 fps.      &#9474;
&#9474;       True 25 / 30 video released at 50 / 60 fps is not allowed and         &#9474;
&#9474;       considered a technical flaw.                                          &#9474;
&#9474;   7.8.1) In rare situations, 25 / 50 fps sources should be restored to      &#9474;
&#9474;          24 or 30 fps.                                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   7.8.2) In rare situations, 30 / 60 fps sources should be restored to      &#9474;
&#9474;          25 fps.                                                            &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 8) [ Audio ]                                                                &#9474;
&#9474;  8.1) Audio must be in the original format provided. Minor adjustments      &#9474;
&#9474;       (channel count, adding or removing frames) in order to prevent issues &#9474;
&#9474;       with playback or sync is allowed.                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   8.1.1) Valid lossy codecs are: AAC, AC3, DTS, DTS-ES, E-AC3, MP2.         &#9474;
&#9474;   8.1.2) For audio originally packaged in a lossless (LPCM) format, audio   &#9474;
&#9474;          must be converted to a lossy format without any down-mixing of     &#9474;
&#9474;          surround channels. e.g. AC3 640 Kbps, DTS 1536 Kbps, and FLAC.     &#9474;
&#9474;  8.2) Transcoding lossy audio to another lossy format is not allowed.       &#9474;
&#9474;  8.3) Sync must not drift at all during the entire release.                 &#9474;
&#9474;  8.4) Glitches that occur in any audio channel present (e.g. L, R, C, SL,   &#9474;
&#9474;       SR, etc.) are considered a technical flaw.                            &#9474;
&#9474;   8.4.1) Except in situations where glitches are a result of a live-stream  &#9474;
&#9474;          or issues with the broadcast or source and are completely          &#9474;
&#9474;          unavoidable. It is recommended, but optional, to mention glitches  &#9474;
&#9474;          or gaps in playback in the NFO.                                    &#9474;
&#9474;   8.4.2) Unavoidable glitches as a result of broadcast, live-stream, or     &#9474;
&#9474;          mastering issues may be propered with a glitch-free version.       &#9474;
&#9474;   8.4.3) Glitches are defined as, but not limited to: an audible glitch,    &#9474;
&#9474;          missing audio, pops or clicks as a result of encoding, gaps within &#9474;
&#9474;          playback, missing dialogue, muted or muffled audio, echoing.       &#9474;
&#9474;  8.5) A release must only contain a single audio track.                     &#9474;

&#9474;  8.6) If the original language of a title is not English:                   &#9474;
&#9474;   8.6.1) An English dubbed track is allowed as a secondary audio track.     &#9474;
&#9474;   8.6.2) Releases containing only a dubbed audio track must be tagged as    &#9474;
&#9474;          DUBBED.                                                            &#9474;
&#9474;  8.7) Non-English releases without a secondary English audio track must     &#9474;
&#9474;       use a language tag indicating the primary spoken language.            &#9474;
&#9474;  8.8) Dupes based on audio format or multiple audio tracks are not allowed, &#9474;
&#9474;       use INTERNAL.                                                         &#9474;
&#9474;  8.9) Retail audio may be used in placed of audio tracks extracted from     &#9474;
&#9474;       the source. Proof of the source disc must be provided, see            &#9474;
&#9474;       section 13.                                                           &#9474;

&#9474;   17.13.5) Any deviations or changes require sufficient evidence listed in  &#9474;
&#9474;            the NFO as to the reason for change.                             &#9474;
&#9474;  17.14) For shows which begin on network television and continue            &#9474;
&#9474;         exclusively on a web-based service, the title or numbering of the   &#9474;

&#9474;  18.2) Any other form of fix is not allowed.                                &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. RARFIX, SFVFIX, SUBFIX, etc.                                   &#9474;
&#9474;  18.3) All fixes require an NFO and must state which release is being       &#9474;
&#9474;        fixed.                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;  18.4) A proper may not be released for an error that can be fixed with     &#9474;
&#9474;        the above methods, with the exception of proof fixes, see rule       &#9474;
&#9474;        13.3.2.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;  18.5) If multiple releases from a single season require a DIRFIX, a single &#9474;
&#9474;        DIRFIX per season is allowed and is recommended.                     &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. Show.Name.S01.DIRFIX.WEBRip.x264-GROUP.                        &#9474;
&#9474;  18.5.1) If a single DIRFIX is used, all relevant releases and              &#9474;
&#9474;          corresponding fixes must be listed in the NFO.                     &#9474;

&#9474;  19.1) Same second releases, with a maximum acceptable variance of two      &#9474;
&#9474;        seconds (+/- 2 seconds) between timestamps reported by a majority    &#9474;
&#9474;        of pre bots, are not considered dupes and should not be nuked.       &#9474;
&#9474;   19.1.1) Timestamps must be considered as whole integers and round half    &#9474;
&#9474;           towards zero.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   19.1.2) The earliest timestamp must be used when considering dupes.       &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. Release A: 1451572201.427158 -> 1451572201                  &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release B: 1451572203.626645 -> 1451572203                  &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release C: 1451572204.137665 -> 1451572204                  &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release B does not dupe Release A: 1451572203 - 1451572201  &#9474;
&#9474;                 = 2, i.e. maximum variance allowed.                         &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release C dupes Releases A and B: 1451572204 - 1451572201   &#9474;
&#9474;                 = 3, i.e. 3 > 2.                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   19.1.3) In situations where a release is found to contain a technical     &#9474;
&#9474;           flaw, same second dupes which do not exhibit any technical flaws  &#9474;
&#9474;           must be considered the final release. Groups may release a DIRFIX &#9474;
&#9474;           to PROPER for their original release, but it is not required.     &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. Release A and Release B are released at the same time.      &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release A is nuked as containing glitches, Release B then   &#9474;
&#9474;                 becomes the de facto release and a DIRFIX to PROPER may be  &#9474;
&#9474;                 released.                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;  19.2) WEBRip.x264 dupes WEB.H264/x264.                                     &#9474;
&#9474;  19.3) WEB.H264/x264 does not dupe WEBRip.x264.                             &#9474;
&#9474;  19.4) WEB.H264/x264 and WEBRip.x264 does not dupe DSR/PDTV.                &#9474;

&#9474;        release.                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   19.5.1) SD WEB.H264/x264 and WEBRip.x264 dupes an SD AHDTV/HDTV/Retail    &#9474;
&#9474;           release.                                                          &#9474;
&#9474;   19.5.2) 720p, 1080p, 2160p WEB.H264/WEB.x264 and WEBRip.x264 dupes a      &#9474;
&#9474;           respective AHDTV/HDTV/Retail release.                             &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. 720p.WEB.H264 dupes 720p.HDTV.x264, 1080p.WEBRip.x264       &#9474;
&#9474;                 dupes 1080p.AHDTV.x264.                                     &#9474;
&#9474;                 1080p.WEB.H264 does not dupe 720p.BluRay.x264 if            &#9474;
&#9474;                 1080p.BluRay.x264 does not exist.                           &#9474;
&#9474;   19.5.3) Except in situations where the aspect ratio of a                  &#9474;
&#9474;           WEB.H264/x264 and WEBRip.x264 release exceeds that of its         &#9474;
&#9474;           respective AHDTV/HDTV/Retail release.                             &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. A 2.39:1 release will not dupe a 1.78:1 retail provided     &#9474;
&#9474;                 there is clearly more footage visible on-screen. Proof      &#9474;
&#9474;                 demonstrating this difference is recommended, but not       &#9474;
&#9474;                 mandatory.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   19.5.4) Except in situations where a WEB.H264/x264 or WEBRip.x264 release &#9474;
&#9474;           is an uncensored or extended edit of its respective               &#9474;
&#9474;           AHDTV/HDTV/Retail release.                                        &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. An uncensored WEB.H264 release does not dupe HDTV.x264,     &#9474;
&#9474;                 EXTENDED.WEBRip.x264 does not dupe BluRay.x264.             &#9474;
&#9474;  19.6) Releases with hardcoded subtitles (i.e. SUBBED) dupes releases with  &#9474;
&#9474;        muxed-in subtitles.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;  19.7) Releases with muxed-in subtitles do not dupe releases with hardcoded &#9474;
&#9474;        subtitles.                                                           &#9474;

&#9474; 20) [ Propers / Rerips / Repacks ]                                          &#9474;
&#9474;  20.1) Detailed reasons must be included in the NFO for all repacks,        &#9474;
&#9474;        rerips, and propers.                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   20.1.1) Proper reasons must be clearly stated in the NFO, including       &#9474;
&#9474;           timestamps and specifics in regards to the flaw when appropriate. &#9474;
&#9474;           A sample demonstrating the flaw in the original release is        &#9474;
&#9474;           encouraged, but not mandatory.                                    &#9474;
&#9474;  20.2) Propers are only permitted in the case of a technical flaw in the    &#9474;
&#9474;        original release.                                                    &#9474;
&#9474;  20.3) If fixing a technical flaw requires transcoding of the file, it must &#9474;
&#9474;        follow the transcoding rules and tagged as WEBRip.x264.              &#9474;
&#9474;  20.4) Transcoded releases cannot proper any untouched files.               &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. WEBRip.x264 cannot proper WEB.H264.                            &#9474;
&#9474;   20.4.1) Unless it is a transcode of a lossless stream correcting the      &#9474;
&#9474;           technical flaw, see rule 1.4.                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   20.4.2) Unless it can be proven that all untouched sources are flawed     &#9474;
&#9474;           which cannot be repaired by transcoding, but a WEBRip does not    &#9474;
&#9474;           exhibit the same technical flaw(s).                               &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. iTunes, Amazon, and Netflix only offer the content. Amazon  &#9474;
&#9474;                 and iTunes sourced files cannot be repaired by transcoding, &#9474;
&#9474;                 however a Netflix WEBRip is fine.                           &#9474;
&#9474;  20.5) Untouched files can proper transcoded releases for any valid         &#9474;
&#9474;        technical flaw.                                                      &#9474;
&#9474;  20.6) Audio or visual glitches can be propered with a release which does   &#9474;
&#9474;        not exhibit the same flaw.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   20.6.1) In situations where mastering issues results in visual or audio   &#9474;
&#9474;           glitches, a release must not be nuked until a valid proper,       &#9474;
&#9474;           repack, or rerip using a glitch-free source or master is          &#9474;
&#9474;           released.                                                         &#9474;
&#9474;  20.7) RERIP must be used for ripping or encoding issues.                   &#9474;
&#9474;  20.8) REPACK must be used for packing or muxing issues.                    &#9474;
&#9474;  20.9) Propers are only valid for releases with timestamps after the        &#9474;
&#9474;        official start date of this ruleset.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   20.9.1) Groups cannot proper existing releases using rules created as a   &#9474;
&#9474;           result of this ruleset.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. If the resolution is not mod 2 or x264 revision used is     &#9474;
&#9474;                 older than 50 revisions at the time of pre, the release     &#9474;
&#9474;                 cannot be nuked.                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   20.9.2) With exceptions of a release containing technical flaws which     &#9474;
&#9474;           would apply to any ruleset regardless of section. e.g. bad IVTC,  &#9474;
&#9474;           sync issues, bad or invalid cropping, etc.                        &#9474;

&#9474;           groups may provide an NFOFIX to avoid or reverse a nuke.          &#9474;
&#9474;  21.4) Using DIRFIX.INTERNAL to avoid a nuke is not allowed, and must be    &#9474;
&#9474;        nuked fix.for.nuke.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 22) [ Ruleset Specifics ]                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;  22.1) This ruleset is to be considered the ONLY official ruleset in        &#9474;
&#9474;        regards to WEB and WEBRip releases. It supersedes all previous       &#9474;
&#9474;        rules and precedents derived from existing TV and Retail rules in    &#9474;
&#9474;        regards to WEB sources.                                              &#9474;
&#9474;  22.2) Rules listed under untouched or transcoded labelled sections only    &#9474;
&#9474;        apply to releases of that type and supersede any similar rule        &#9474;
&#9474;        mentioned elsewhere.                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. Rule 6.1 defines SD as resolutions with a maximum horizontal   &#9474;
&#9474;              display of 720 pixels, unless the release is considered        &#9474;
&#9474;              untouched, in which case rule 1.6 applies.                     &#9474;
&#9474;  22.3) If there is a question as to the validity of a source used, the      &#9474;
&#9474;        release may be nuked within 24 hours of pre requesting a source      &#9474;
&#9474;        sample and must include the initial suspicion or reason.             &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. source.sample.requested_suspicion.of.invalid.decimation.       &#9474;
&#9474;   22.3.1) The group has 24 hours from the first nuke to pre a source        &#9474;
&#9474;           sample that is at least 10 seconds in length.                     &#9474;
&#9474;   22.3.2) Source samples must be packed with RAR files, and use the         &#9474;
&#9474;           SOURCE.SAMPLE tag.                                                &#9474;
&#9474;   22.3.3) Providing insufficient proof to disprove any claims, or a         &#9474;
&#9474;           failure to provide any source proof, and the release must remain  &#9474;
&#9474;           nuked and can be propered.                                        &#9474;
&#9474;  22.4) The following definition of keywords throughout this ruleset are as  &#9474;
&#9474;        follows:                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   22.4.1) Must: the rule is explicit in the definition and is compulsory.   &#9474;
&#9474;   22.4.2) Should: implies the rule is a suggestion, and is non-compulsory.  &#9474;
&#9474;   22.4.3) Can or may: implies the rule is optional, and is non-compulsory.  &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 23) [ Notes ]                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;  23.1) Proof is only enforced for iTunes as all other sources require       &#9474;
&#9474;        various unofficial (backdoor) methods of downloading. Creating a     &#9474;
&#9474;        fake GUI showing an active download is not difficult, which could    &#9474;
&#9474;        result in proof being fabricated. As such, it is pointless to        &#9474;
&#9474;        require proof for anything but iTunes, where streams can only be     &#9474;
&#9474;        downloaded by a single method.                                       &#9474;
&#9474;   23.1.1) This includes web stores or shops which provide video files via a &#9474;
&#9474;           regular HTTP download. Policing or moderating these methods would &#9474;
&#9474;           be implausible for a single ruleset. Providing screenshots of a   &#9474;
&#9474;           download in progress from a website does not prove the file was   &#9474;
&#9474;           obtained from an official source.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;  23.2) The burden of proving P2P source material is on the propering group  &#9474;
&#9474;        or nuker.                                                            &#9474;
&#9474;  23.3) The inclusion of 2-pass in this ruleset should not be misconstrued   &#9474;
&#9474;        as preferring it for every release, CRF must always be considered    &#9474;
&#9474;        the primary method. Instead, it is encouraged for groups to use      &#9474;
&#9474;        2-pass methods for rare cases when files provided are of extreme     &#9474;
&#9474;        high quality.                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;   23.3.1) Video which contains an excessive amount of noise may often       &#9474;
&#9474;           result in an unnecessary large bitrate. In such situations,       &#9474;
&#9474;           using a smaller bitrate using 2-pass can result in a file size    &#9474;
&#9474;           improvement with negligible loss in video quality.                &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
