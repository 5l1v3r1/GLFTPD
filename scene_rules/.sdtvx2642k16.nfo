&#9474; Since the last revision of this document in 2012, TV-X264-SD has grown      &#9474;
&#9474; and become a major section that many people contribute to and depend on.    &#9474;
&#9474; This new revision aims to update the standards from 2012 to standards       &#9474;
&#9474; suitable for 2016 and the future. Adding clarity and patching loopholes     &#9474;
&#9474; to once again allow for consistent and quality releases, which was the      &#9474;
&#9474; aim of this standard back in 2012.                                          &#9474;

&#9474; 1) [ HDTV Sources ]                                                         &#9474;
&#9474;  1.1) HDTV is considered as a high definition natively recorded transport   &#9474;
&#9474;       stream.                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;  1.2) HDTV sources must not be upscaled, see section 2.                     &#9474;
&#9474;  1.3) Providers which downscale 1080i to 720p (e.g. BellTV) are not         &#9474;
&#9474;       allowed.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 2) [ PDTV &#38; DSR Sources ]                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;  2.1) PDTV is considered as a 576i/576p natively recorded transport         &#9474;
&#9474;       stream.                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;  2.2) DSR is considered as a 480i/480p natively recorded transport          &#9474;
&#9474;       stream.                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 3) [ AHDTV &#38; APDTV &#38; ADSR Sources ]                                         &#9474;
&#9474;  3.1) AHDTV, APDTV and ADSR are considered as captured streams from the     &#9474;
&#9474;       analog output (e.g. Component, DVI, HDMI) of a set-top box.           &#9474;
&#9474;  3.2) Captures must be done at the native broadcast format of the source.   &#9474;
&#9474;   3.2.1) Captures from devices which are unable to output a native format   &#9474;
&#9474;          must be restored to the original framerate.                        &#9474;
&#9474;   3.2.2) If captures cannot be completely restored to their native          &#9474;
&#9474;          framerate, such as a single dupe frame every 1000 or blended/ghost &#9474;
&#9474;          frames due to mangling from the set-top box or capture device,     &#9474;
&#9474;          this is considered a technical flaw.                               &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474; 4) [ Codec ]                                                                &#9474;
&#9474;  4.1) Video must be H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoded with x264 8-bit.               &#9474;
&#9474;   4.1.1) Custom builds of x264 (e.g. x264-tMod, x264-kMod) are allowed and  &#9474;
&#9474;          must be based off the x264 codebase.                               &#9474;
&#9474;  4.2) x264 headers must remain intact and must not be modified or removed.  &#9474;
&#9474;  4.3) x264 must be kept up to date, with a maximum allowance, or grace      &#9474;
&#9474;       period, of 60 days before groups are required to update to the latest &#9474;
&#9474;       revision.                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   4.3.1) The official x264 git repository is the only reference for         &#9474;
&#9474;          determining the current revision:                                  &#9474;
&#9474;          http://git.videolan.org/?p=x264.git;a=summary                      &#9474;
&#9474;   4.3.2) The 60 day grace period must only be applied at pre time, not the  &#9474;
&#9474;          tagged encoded date.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   4.3.3) The grace period is only applicable to the revision preceding the  &#9474;
&#9474;          latest update and does not reset active grace periods of preceding &#9474;
&#9474;          revisions.                                                         &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. 2016-01-01: Revision A is used.                              &#9474;
&#9474;                2016-01-02: Revision B is committed, 60-day grace period     &#9474;
&#9474;                begins for revision A.                                       &#9474;
&#9474;                2016-01-05: Revision C is committed, 60-day grace period     &#9474;
&#9474;                begins for revision B.                                       &#9474;
&#9474;                2016-03-02: Revision A is no longer allowed, Revision B or   &#9474;
&#9474;                C may be used.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;                2016-03-05: Revision B is no longer allowed, Revision C must &#9474;
&#9474;                be used.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;  4.4) Constant Rate Factor (--crf) must be used.                            &#9474;
&#9474;   4.4.1) CRF values below 19 and above 24 are never allowed.                &#9474;
&#9474;   4.4.2) Justification must be listed in the NFO for the use of             &#9474;
&#9474;          non-standard CRF values.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;    4.4.2.1) Groups are not required to follow non-standard CRF values used  &#9474;
&#9474;             by another group.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;    4.4.2.2) It is suggested that if the average video bitrate exceeds       &#9474;
&#9474;             1500kb/s, a higher CRF value should be chosen, when possible.   &#9474;
&#9474;  4.5) Standard CRF values are as follows:                                   &#9474;

&#9474;   5.7.2) Releases which contain at least an additional 20 pixels worth of   &#9474;
&#9474;          video on any side are not considered dupes. These releases must    &#9474;

&#9474;    5.8.1.1) Faded edges refer to a line of pixels which are of similar      &#9474;
&#9474;             appearance to pixels&#39; parallel to the video frame.              &#9474;

&#9474;    5.8.3.1) Cropping out hardcoded subtitles entirely is allowed, only      &#9474;
&#9474;             when they are not required, leaving any trace of subtitles or   &#9474;
&#9474;             over-cropping actual picture to remove subtitles is considered  &#9474;
&#9474;             to be a technical flaw.                                         &#9474;
&#9474;   5.8.4) Video may be over or under cropped by a maximum of 1px per side.   &#9474;
&#9474;          Over or under cropping by more than 1px per side is considered a   &#9474;
&#9474;          technical flaw.                                                    &#9474;

&#9474;       30 FPS video released at 50 / 60 FPS is not allowed and considered a  &#9474;
&#9474;       technical flaw.                                                       &#9474;
&#9474;   7.2.1) Failure to apply a deinterlacer with bobbing enabled (e.g. QTGMC,  &#9474;
&#9474;          Yadif(mode=1)) to double framerate (bob) 25i / 30i video back to   &#9474;
&#9474;          true 50 / 60 FPS, is considered a technical flaw.                  &#9474;
&#9474;   7.2.2) In cases of varying framerates of 25 / 30 FPS and true 50 / 60     &#9474;
&#9474;          FPS, the framerate of the main feature must be used (e.g. studio   &#9474;
&#9474;          for talk shows, game coverage for sports).                         &#9474;
&#9474;   7.2.3) In rare situations, 25 / 50 FPS sources must be restored to 24 or  &#9474;

&#9474;       sources) and may or may not require IVTC is left to the discretion    &#9474;
&#9474;       of the group. The NFO must list a reason as to the final decision.    &#9474;
&#9474;   7.3.1) It is assumed that the majority of a title contains enough unique  &#9474;
&#9474;          frames at 30,000/1,001 FPS to warrant a higher framerate. If it    &#9474;
&#9474;          can be proven IVTC/decimating does not result in any loss of       &#9474;
&#9474;          unique frames, this is considered a technical flaw.                &#9474;
&#9474;  7.4) Native and converted framerates refers to the standard in which the   &#9474;
&#9474;       video was produced.                                                   &#9474;

&#9474;  7.5) Converted video that has significant abnormalities (e.g. blended      &#9474;
&#9474;       frames, jerky playback due to missing or duplicate frames) due to     &#9474;
&#9474;       the conversion and cannot be reversed to the native format must be    &#9474;
&#9474;       tagged as CONVERT.                                                    &#9474;

&#9474;       at least 30 seconds throughout the entire release is considered a     &#9474;
&#9474;       technical flaw.                                                       &#9474;
&#9474;  9.3) Video frame abnormalities (e.g. Abnormal snipes/pop-ups, banner       &#9474;
&#9474;       advertisements that do not fade out entirely) as a result of broken   &#9474;
&#9474;       splicing originating from the broadcasting station is considered a    &#9474;
&#9474;       technical flaw.                                                       &#9474;
&#9474;  9.4) Missing or repeated video footage without any loss of dialogue must   &#9474;

&#9474;   9.4.1) Except in situations where on-screen text is lost due to missing   &#9474;
&#9474;          footage. Loss of on-screen text is considered a technical flaw.    &#9474;
&#9474;   9.4.2) Except in situations where minor missing or repeated video         &#9474;
&#9474;          footage flaws are present throughout the majority of the release.  &#9474;
&#9474;          Excessive flaws such as these are considered a technical flaw.     &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. Video frame glitches occurring every 2 minutes throughout    &#9474;
&#9474;                the entire release but only in the amount of 1 second per    &#9474;
&#9474;                instance, is considered excessive and a technical flaw.      &#9474;
&#9474;                Repeated footage occurring every 5 minutes throughout the    &#9474;
&#9474;                entire release but only in the amount of 1.5 seconds per     &#9474;
&#9474;                instance, is considered excessive and a technical flaw.      &#9474;
&#9474;                Video frame glitches of 1 second per instance occurring 6    &#9474;
&#9474;                times throughout the entire release is NOT considered        &#9474;

&#9474;  15.1) Only the following additional tags are allowed:                      &#9474;

&#9474;         UNCENSORED, UNRATED, UNCUT, WEST.FEED, and WS.                      &#9474;
&#9474;   15.1.1) WEST.FEED refers to an alternative version which airs             &#9474;
&#9474;           exclusively on the west coast, such as a live episode of          &#9474;
&#9474;           Undateable which has two separate performances of the same        &#9474;
&#9474;           episode for each coast, east and west.                            &#9474;
&#9474;    15.1.1.1) Releases must be tagged as WEST.FEED when they come from an    &#9474;
&#9474;              exclusive west coast airing, even if no east feed has been     &#9474;
&#9474;              released first.                                                &#9474;
&#9474;  15.2) Variations of any additional tags are not allowed.                   &#9474;

&#9474;  15.3) READNFO should be used sparingly. Discretion is recommended.         &#9474;
&#9474;   15.3.1) The READNFO tag must not be used with PROPER, REPACK or RERIP.    &#9474;
&#9474;           The NFO is required to contain a reason, therefore the tag is     &#9474;
&#9474;           redundant.                                                        &#9474;
&#9474;  15.4) Tags must only be used once, but the order is left to the            &#9474;

&#9474;   15.4.1) Except in situations where the REAL tag is required to be         &#9474;
&#9474;           stacked to differentiate between multiple invalid releases.       &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. A REAL.REAL.PROPER is required for a REAL.PROPER and        &#9474;
&#9474;                 PROPER.                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;  15.5) Tags must be grouped together, period-delimited, and must follow the &#9474;
&#9474;        mandatory directory format, see rule 16.4.                           &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. EXTENDED.RERIP, REMASTERED.REPACK.                             &#9474;

&#9474;  18.1) Same second releases, with a maximum acceptable variance of one      &#9474;
&#9474;        second (+/- 1 second) between timestamps reported by a majority of   &#9474;
&#9474;        pre bots, are not considered dupes and should not be nuked.          &#9474;
&#9474;   18.1.1) Timestamps must be considered as whole integers and round half    &#9474;
&#9474;           towards zero.                                                     &#9474;

&#9474;                 Release B does not dupe Release A: 1451572202 &#251; 1451572201  &#9474;
&#9474;                 = 1, i.e. maximum variance allowed.                         &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release C dupes Releases A and B: 1451572203 &#251; 1451572201   &#9474;
&#9474;                 = 2, i.e. 2 > 1.                                            &#9474;

&#9474;           flaw, same second dupes which do not exhibit any technical flaws  &#9474;
&#9474;           must be considered the final release. Groups may release a        &#9474;
&#9474;           DIRFIX to PROPER for their original release, but it is not        &#9474;
            required.                                                         &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. Release A and Release B are released at the same time.      &#9474;
&#9474;                 Release A is nuked as containing glitches, Release B then   &#9474;
&#9474;                 becomes the de facto release and a DIRFIX to PROPER may     &#9474;
&#9474;                 be released.                                                &#9474;
&#9474;  18.2) AHDTV dupes HDTV.                                                    &#9474;

&#9474;        release.                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   18.8.1) Except in situations where the aspect ratio of the release        &#9474;
&#9474;           exceeds that of its respective Retail release.                    &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. A 2.39:1 release will not dupe a 1.78:1 retail release      &#9474;
&#9474;                 provided there is clearly more visible on-screen footage.   &#9474;
&#9474;                 Proof demonstrating this difference is recommended, but     &#9474;
&#9474;                 not mandatory.                                              &#9474;

&#9474;           UNCENSORED, UNRATED, UNCUT, WEST.FEED, WS) of its respective      &#9474;
&#9474;           retail release, and is not censored after uncensored.             &#9474;
&#9474;            e.g. An UNCENSORED.HDTV.x264 release does not dupe a censored    &#9474;
&#9474;                 BluRay.x264.                                                &#9474;
&#9474;  18.9) Releases with hardcoded subtitles (i.e. SUBBED) dupe releases with   &#9474;

&#9474;         EXTENDED, OAR, OM, REMASTERED, UNCENSORED, UNRATED, UNCUT,          &#9474;
&#9474;         WEST.FEED, WS) do not dupe their counterparts or vice versa,        &#9474;
&#9474;         except for censored after uncensored and FS after WS.               &#9474;
&#9474;  18.14) Programs which have identical footage but have different narrators  &#9474;
&#9474;         in the same language (e.g. British narrator for BBC and American    &#9474;

&#9474;  21.1) In the absence of a country specific ruleset, this ruleset must be   &#9474;
&#9474;        considered the ONLY official ruleset for TV-X264-SD. It supersedes   &#9474;
&#9474;        all previous revisions, rulesets and precedents.                     &#9474;
&#9474;   21.1.1) Releasing under former rulesets (e.g. TV-VCD 2002, TV-XVID 2007)  &#9474;
&#9474;           or codecs (e.g. VCD, XVID) is not allowed, and must be nuked      &#9474;
&#9474;           defunct.ruleset or defunct.codec.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   21.1.2) The naming standards listed in this document must only take       &#9474;
&#9474;           effect once a current running season has ended. Any existing      &#9474;
&#9474;           naming schemes must be used in the event of missing episode(s)    &#9474;
&#9474;           from older seasons being filled.                                  &#9474;
&#9474;  21.2) When releasing with foreign language tags (e.g. SWEDISH, FRENCH,     &#9474;

&#9474;        and 11 must be replaced with the tagged language.                    &#9474;
&#9474;         e.g. POLISH, rule 5.6 becomes &#34;Non-Polish spoken titles with        &#9474;
&#9474;              hardcoded Polish subtitles must be tagged as SUBBED.&#34;.         &#9474;

&#9474;             SUBFRENCH, NLSUBBED).                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   21.2.1.2) The DUBBED tag may be omitted or included at the discretion     &#9474;

&#9474;              e.g. French TV series airing in Sweden with French audio and   &#9474;
&#9474;                   Swedish hardcoded subtitles must be tagged as             &#9474;
&#9474;                   SWEDISH.SUBBED or SWESUB.                                 &#9474;
&#9474;                   Danish TV series airing in Poland with Polish dubbed      &#9474;
&#9474;                   audio and no hardcoded subtitles must be tagged as        &#9474;
&#9474;                   POLISH, POLISH.DUBBED or PLDUB.                           &#9474;
&#9474;                   Greek TV series airing in Greece with Greek audio must    &#9474;
&#9474;                   be tagged as GREEK.                                       &#9474;
&#9474;   21.2.1.3) Soft-subbed releases are not allowed when the primary audio     &#9474;
&#9474;             track is not the language tagged as, use INTERNAL or SUBPACK.   &#9474;
&#9474;              e.g. Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.SWEDISH.HDTV with English audio    &#9474;
&#9474;                   and Swedish soft-subs is not allowed, use INTERNAL or     &#9474;
&#9474;                   SUBPACK.                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;                   Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.DANISH.SUBBED.HDTV with English    &#9474;
&#9474;                   audio and Danish hard-subs is allowed.                    &#9474;
&#9474;                   French TV series Le Clan S01E01 airing in Denmark with    &#9474;
&#9474;                   French audio and Danish soft subtitles must be tagged     &#9474;
&#9474;                   as FRENCH, if no other release of the episode exists.     &#9474;
&#9474;                   French TV series Le Clan is already released as           &#9474;
&#9474;                   Le.Clan.S01E01.FRENCH.HDTV.x264, only an INTERNAL or      &#9474;
&#9474;                   SUBPACK release is allowed for soft-subs in another       &#9474;
&#9474;                   language.                                                 &#9474;

&#9474;             is not the language tagged as, use INTERNAL.                    &#9474;
&#9474;              e.g. Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.TURKISH.SUBBED.HDTV with English   &#9474;
&#9474;                   audio and Turkish hard-subs dupes                         &#9474;
&#9474;                   Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.TURKISH.SUBPACK.                   &#9474;
&#9474;  21.2.2) Releases with foreign language tags only dupe releases with the    &#9474;
&#9474;          same foreign language tags.                                        &#9474;
&#9474;           e.g. Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.SWEDISH.SUBBED.HDTV does not dupe     &#9474;
&#9474;                Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.POLISH.DUBBED.HDTV or vice versa.     &#9474;
&#9474;                Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.FINNISH.SUBBED.HDTV does not dupe     &#9474;
