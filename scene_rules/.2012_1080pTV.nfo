&#9474;   - As a general suggestion, average video bitrate in excess of 7000kb/s    &#9474;
&#9474;     is a sign that a higher CRF value should be chosen, when possible       &#9474;

&#9474;     directory name, except for UK shows (e.g. The.Marriage.Ref.UK not       &#9474;
&#9474;     The.Marriage.Ref.GB). ISO country code is not needed for the original   &#9474;
&#9474;     show (e.g. The.Marriage.Ref.US is forbidden).                           &#9474;
&#9474;   - Different shows with the same name in the same country produced in      &#9474;
&#9474;     different years must have the year of the first season in the directory &#9474;
&#9474;     name, e.g. Human.Target.2010 and Doctor.Who.2005. Year is not needed    &#9474;
&#9474;     for the first show with a particular name.                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - Channel name (e.g. National.Geographic, History.Channel) shall not be   &#9474;
&#9474;     tagged on any normal series starting after this ruleset&#39;s effective     &#9474;
&#9474;     date. Miniseries and single-episode docus may optionally be tagged with &#9474;
&#9474;     the channel name.                                                       &#9474;

&#9474;   - PROPER.READ.NFO is NOT allowed. The NFO is REQUIRED to have a reason;   &#9474;
&#9474;     therefore, the tag is redundant.                                        &#9474;
&#9474;   - All repacks must include detailed reason as to why it&#39;s being repacked  &#9474;
