&#188;  Thanks to those who came before with TVx2642K7, TDX2K2, and TXD2K5.        &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;
&#188;  These standards are intended to bring a level playing field to the TV-XviD &#188;
&#188;  scene and attempt to put down some rules to end some of the controversy    &#188;
&#188;  that has plagued us in recent years.                                       &#188;

&#188;  - Best effort should be made to release all episodes of a given series     &#188;
&#188;    at the same size. If one episode runs slightly over or under the size    &#188;
&#188;    lines, it should still be done at the same size as other episodes in     &#188;
&#188;    order to maintain consistency.                                           &#188;

&#188;  - 2CD releases may be optionally split into separate discs, but this is    &#188;

&#188;    placed in directories named CD1, CD2, CD3, etc. (No Disc1, cd1, or other &#188;
&#188;    naming styles).                                                          &#188;

&#188;    - Other numbering formats such as S00.E00, DD.MM.YY, and MM.DD.YY are    &#188;
&#188;      not permitted                                                          &#188;
&#188;    - For variety shows, it is strongly recommended that the primary         &#188;
&#188;      guest&#39;s name be included in the directory name                         &#188;
&#188;    - Different shows that have the same name in different countries should  &#188;
&#188;      be tagged with the ISO country code for the country of airing          &#188;
&#188;      - example Big.Brother.US.S01E01.PDTV.XviD-Group                        &#188;
&#188;    - Different shows with the same name produced in different years should  &#188;
&#188;      be tagged with the year of airing of the first season                  &#188;
&#188;      - example Battlestar.Galactica.2003.S03E01.HDTV.XviD-Group             &#188;
&#188;    - Releases are to be named in the format                                 &#188;
&#188;      Show.Name.S00E00.HDTV.XviD-Group                                       &#188;

&#188;    - The episode title may optionally be included between the episode       &#188;
&#188;      number and the source                                                  &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;
&#188;  - Additional Tagging:                                                      &#188;
&#188;    - PROPER, REPACK, RERIP, REAL, UNCUT, SUBBED, iNTERNAL, DIRFIX,          &#188;
&#188;      SAMPLEFIX, NFOFIX, or Read.NFO are allowed (discretion is recommended) &#188;
&#188;    - All releases tagged PROPER, REPACK, RERIP, REAL, and Read.NFO must     &#188;
&#188;      include notes in the NFO as to why the release was tagged that way.    &#188;
&#188;      PROPER.Read.NFO is therefore redundant and should not be used.         &#188;
&#188;    - Additional tagging should be placed directly before the source, i.e.   &#188;
&#188;      Show.Name.S00E00.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-Group                                &#188;

&#188;  - Source Naming:                                                           &#188;
&#188;    - Valid source names are DSR, WS.DSR, PDTV, WS.PDTV, HDTV, and no tag    &#188;
&#188;      - Analog source will have no tag other than WS if appropriate.         &#188;
&#188;    - Source Definitons:                                                     &#188;
&#188;      - 480i\576i\576p shall be tagged DSR when horizontal resolution is     &#188;
&#188;        less than 704px                                                      &#188;
&#188;      - 480i\576i\576p shall be tagged PDTV when horizontal resolution is    &#188;
&#188;        greater than or equal to 704px                                       &#188;
&#188;      - 720p\1080i\1080p shall be tagged HDTV                                &#188;

&#188;        black on the top and bottom)\Native 16:9 content shall be labeled as &#188;
&#188;        Widescreen (WS.DSR or WS.PDTV)                                       &#188;
&#188;      - The use of the HDTV tag implies widescreen, so WS.HDTV shall not     &#188;
&#188;        be used                                                              &#188;
&#188;    - All sources listed must be 100% digital. S-Video, composite, or RF     &#188;
&#188;      from a digital receiver to a tuner card is analog. Valid DSR, PDTV,    &#188;
&#188;      and HDTV sources will be received via a digital connection such as     &#188;
&#188;      USB, Firewire, or Ethernet from a receiver, or using an ATSC, QAM, or  &#188;
&#188;      DVB tuner.                                                             &#188;

&#188;    - The AVI itself should be named like the release and include some       &#188;
&#188;      format of episode number (show initials are fine, as is shortening the &#188;
&#188;      episode number)                                                        &#188;

&#188;    - An SFV must be created for all RAR files in the release                &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;

&#188;    - All releases must include a sample of length :50-1:10, cut directly    &#188;
&#188;      from the release                                                       &#188;
&#188;    - The sample must be placed in a directory named Sample (SAMPLE and      &#188;
&#188;      sample are not permitted)                                              &#188;
&#188;    - The file itself should be named uniquely, preferably containing the    &#188;
&#188;      name of the release as well as the word sample                         &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;

&#188;  Propers:                                                                   &#188;
&#188;  - Propers are only permitted in the case of technical flaws with the       &#188;
&#188;    original release or violations of applicable rules                       &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;
&#188;  - All propers must include a note in the NFO detailing the flaw in the     &#188;
&#188;    original release, including timecodes if relevant                        &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;
&#188;  - Including a sample of the flaw is suggested but not required             &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;
&#188;  - Propers are expressly permitted in cases of any of the following flaws   &#188;
&#188;    in a release:                                                            &#188;
&#188;    - Audio 150ms or more out of sync                                        &#188;
&#188;    - Severe audio drops resulting in the inability to understand material   &#188;
&#188;      dialogue                                                               &#188;
&#188;    - Improper audio normalization, including audio with levels that vary    &#188;
&#188;      widely between parts, very quiet audio, or audio with excessive        &#188;
&#188;      clipping                                                               &#188;
&#188;    - Bad cropping resulting in a line of black pixels or noise along an     &#188;
&#188;      edge for the entire episode                                            &#188;
&#188;    - Releases missing a significant portion of video, either in duration    &#188;
&#188;      or content                                                             &#188;
&#188;      - Loss of 2 seconds of fade in after a break, with no lost dialogue,   &#188;
&#188;        is considered bad form, but is not a valid proper reason             &#188;
&#188;    - Change in video format (i.e. PDTV on an HDTV release) exceeding five   &#188;
&#188;      seconds or causing loss of dialogue.                                   &#188;
&#188;    - Local overlays such as weather, breaking news, or Amber Alerts that    &#188;
&#188;      exceed five minutes in length, cause a change in video format (i.e.    &#188;
&#188;      drop to PDTV on an HDTV release), or cause loss of dialogue or video   &#188;
&#188;      - The proper release must be completely free of overlays to be         &#188;
&#188;        considered valid; merely having less spam is not enough              &#188;
&#188;    - Inclusion of 2 or more seconds of commercials over an entire release   &#188;
&#188;    - Releases with sizing outside the allowed range. 3.01MB oversize is a   &#188;
&#188;      valid proper reason.                                                   &#188;
&#188;                                                                             &#188;
