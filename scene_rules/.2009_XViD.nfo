&#9474;   - Allowed sizes are 175MB, 350MB and multiples of 1 CD (700MB).           &#9474;
&#9474;   - The following formula will guide you to get the appropriate size:       &#9474;
&#9474;             target-size = VIDEO-FPS * VIDEO-RUNTIME(in mins) * 0.28         &#9474;
&#9474;     Use the target-size value to index the MAXIMUM allowed size, examples:  &#9474;
&#9474;        target-size = 25.000fps * 98min * 0.28 = 686, MAX size is 1 CD       &#9474;
&#9474;        target-size = 23.976fps * 49min * 0.28 = 329, MAX size is 1/2 CD     &#9474;
&#9474;        target-size = 18.000fps * 65min * 0.28 = 328, MAX size is 1/2 CD     &#9474;
&#9474;     VIDEO-RUNTIME is in minutes only, no fractions, and rounded up to the   &#9474;
&#9474;     next full minute, e.g. 104 min and 5 secs = put 105 min inside the      &#9474;
&#9474;     formula. The following table describes the MAXIMUM size allowed for     &#9474;
&#9474;     each runtime in minutes:                                                &#9474;

&#9474;   - The above table indicates the MAXIMUM size allowed to encode at, but    &#9474;
&#9474;     it is ripper&#39;s discretion to use smaller values, e.g. 110 min PAL movie &#9474;
&#9474;     can use AT MOST 1400MB but can also use lower sizes such as 700MB.      &#9474;
&#9474;   - If at the lowest resolution allowed and MP3 audio bitrate of 128 kbps   &#9474;
&#9474;     average I/P quant is above 4.5, releases may jump 1 size up (e.g. 2 CDs &#9474;
&#9474;     may be used instead of 1). Such cases MUST provide proper proof and     &#9474;
&#9474;     explanation in the nfo.                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - If the formula gives a value below 100MB, sizes smaller than 175MB are  &#9474;
&#9474;     allowed, at ripper&#39;s discretion.                                        &#9474;
&#9474;   - MAXIMUM CD media capacity value is 736966656 bytes = 719694 KB = 702 MB &#9474;
&#9474;   - MINIMUM CD media capacity value is 723517440 bytes = 706560 KB = 690 MB &#9474;
&#9474;   - When using multiple CD releases, releases MUST utilize the full         &#9474;
&#9474;     burnable media capacity for each CD used (each CD must conform to the   &#9474;

&#9474;     * VIDEO-RUNTIME is in minutes only, no fractions, and rounded up to     &#9474;
&#9474;       the next full minute, e.g. 41 min and 5 secs = put 42 min inside the  &#9474;
&#9474;       formula.                                                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - 550MB may be used at ripper&#39;s discretion when target-size is above      &#9474;
&#9474;     260MB.                                                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - If the formula gives a value below 100MB, sizes smaller than 175MB are  &#9474;
&#9474;     allowed, at ripper&#39;s discretion. It is also ripper&#39;s discretion to use  &#9474;
&#9474;     smaller sizes than those targeted by the formula for each specific      &#9474;
&#9474;     runtime and framerate (e.g. a release that should be 350MB according to &#9474;
&#9474;     the formula may also be released at 233MB).                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;   - ABR is considered a VBR technique.                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST be STEREO for STEREO sources, MONO for MONO sources                &#9474;
&#9474;     (Any audio track with identical channels is considered a MONO source).  &#9474;
&#9474;   - MP3 tracks must keep the original frequency as it was on the source&#39;s   &#9474;
&#9474;     audio: e.g. 48khz for 48khz and 44.1khz for 44.1khz.                    &#9474;
&#9474;   - Mono or Dual Mono (1+1) AC3 is forbidden; use mono MP3.                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - MP3 audio must be normalized. Stereo sources must use stereo or         &#9474;
&#9474;     joint-stereo encoding mode. Mono sources must use mono encoding mode;   &#9474;
&#9474;     dual-mono is forbidden.                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - Encoding or re-encoding audio to AC3 is strictly forbidden, except in   &#9474;
&#9474;     in the case of HD retail source (see Source related notes).             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Use of AC3 is at the ripper&#39;s discretion, but should be used wisely.    &#9474;
&#9474;     Choice of AC3 or MP3 is not a technical flaw except as otherwise noted. &#9474;
&#9474;   - Multi-language audio tracks are FORBIDDEN! (Use INTERNAL)               &#9474;

&#9474;   - Keyframe:                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;     MUST be &#60;=20 seconds and MUST be inserted according to scene changes    &#9474;
&#9474;     and framesizes as determined by the codec or encoding application.      &#9474;
&#9474;   - Group watermarks of any kind on the video are forbidden.                &#9474;
&#9474;   - English retail releases may not contain foreign language text overlays  &#9474;
&#9474;     from localized versions.                                                &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;  Framerate:                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST be as close to original source framerate as possible.              &#9474;
&#9474;   - In some cases PAL movies need to be IVTC&#39;d (e.g. to 24fps). Therefore   &#9474;
&#9474;     using a PAL source is not an excuse for lack of IVTC.                   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Hybrid sources are left at ripper&#39;s discretion if to IVTC or not.       &#9474;
&#9474;     Ripper should mention and provide proof to any claim for ITVC or lack   &#9474;
&#9474;     thereof.                                                                &#9474;

&#9474;  Codec:                                                                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST BE XviD (all DivX codecs are banned).                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST use 2 pass technique during encoding.                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - No dupes based on codec type, use INTERNAL!                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;  Resolution and Aspect Ratio:                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Width: 576 - 640 pixels for movies with an AR of 1.70-3.00              &#9474;
&#9474;            512 - 640 pixels for movies with an AR of 1.00-1.69              &#9474;
&#9474;   - Width and Height must be multiples of 16.                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Cropping is required such that black borders are cropped to their       &#9474;
&#9474;     maximum. In the case that the video presents changing ARs, the video    &#9474;
&#9474;     must be cropped such that no frame is overcropped.                      &#9474;
&#9474;     * Over- or undercropping by more than 1 pixel is considered a technical &#9474;
&#9474;       flaw, although it is preferable to crop the 1 pixel out.              &#9474;
&#9474;   - Video encodes must be within 4% of the original aspect ratio.           &#9474;
&#9474;     Calculating AR % error: (Original AR - Release AR)/Original AR x 100    &#9474;
&#9474;   - Non-retail video sources may not have the usual retail aspect ratio     &#9474;
&#9474;     due to different processing. All releases should be based on the actual &#9474;
&#9474;     source AR, not on retail AR listed on IMDB or other sources.            &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Subtitles:                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - OPTIONAL (ONLY if all other requirements have been met).                &#9474;
&#9474;   - Subtitles MUST be packed in a RAR file with the most compression        &#9474;
&#9474;     available. This RAR file shall be placed in a directory named &#39;Subs&#39;    &#9474;
&#9474;     along with an SFV file containing standard checksum information for     &#9474;
&#9474;     that RAR. The subtitles must not be packaged in the main RARs for the   &#9474;
&#9474;     release and the RAR file containing the subtitles must not be listed in &#9474;
&#9474;     main SFV for the release.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Vobsub packs must have the .sub file packed with the MOST compression:  &#9474;
&#9474;     subs.rar = [ &#60;avi-name>.idx + &#60;avi-name>.rar = (&#60;avi-name>.sub) ]       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Burned subtitles are only permissible when present in the source. If    &#9474;
&#9474;     the subtitles overlay both active video and matting (black bars),       &#9474;
&#9474;     cropping to the bottom of the subtitles is permissible, and an equal    &#9474;
&#9474;     amount of matting shall be left at the top. If the burned subtitles     &#9474;
&#9474;     overlay only matting, they must be OCR&#39;ed and cropped out.              &#9474;
&#9474;   - English subs on non-English releases MUST fit in the standard size      &#9474;
&#9474;     with the rest of the release. All other subs are considered optional    &#9474;
&#9474;     and are not required to fit in the standard release size.               &#9474;
&#9474;   - English subs on non-English releases must be synced with the video.     &#9474;
&#9474;   - Foreign releases (non-English spoken) lacking English subtitles MUST be &#9474;
&#9474;     tagged with the spoken language. Releases with English subtitles MUST   &#9474;
&#9474;     NOT be tagged with the spoken language. A release containing English    &#9474;
&#9474;     subtitles after a foreign-tagged release is not considered a dupe,      &#9474;
&#9474;     regardless of whether or not the foreign-tagged release has English     &#9474;
&#9474;     subs.                                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Subtitles on multiple-CD releases must be split. Inclusion of non-split &#9474;
&#9474;     subtitles in addition to the split subtitles is encouraged.             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Custom subtitles are not allowed on retail sources. They may be used    &#9474;
&#9474;     only with non-retail sources. Propers for incorrect or missing dialogue &#9474;
&#9474;     on custom subtitles are not allowed; release a subpack!                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - Multi-language subtitles cannot be used as a basis for a dupe.          &#9474;
&#9474;   - English subbed (with original spoken language) may follow a dubbed      &#9474;
&#9474;     release (in any language); use SUBBED tag.                              &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;
&#9474;  Packaging:                                                                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - All releases MUST be AVI.                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Must be packed with RAR and broken into 15 or 20 MB volumes.            &#9474;
&#9474;     Each AVI for a multiple-CD release must be packaged into separate RAR   &#9474;
&#9474;     volumes.                                                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - Filenames (even subpack rar file) MUST be unique (to avoid dupe).       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Compression is not allowed.                                             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Recovery and MD5 record are recommended.                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - Must have an SFV included for each CD.                                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Must have an NFO.                                                       &#9474;

&#9474;   - Qualitative propers are not allowed, nor are propers based on           &#9474;
&#9474;     decisions made by a ripper (e.g. AC3 or MP3).                           &#9474;
&#9474;   - Propering a release done under a previous ruleset timeline is allowed   &#9474;
&#9474;     if it has a technical flaw, such as bad.ar, bad.ivtc, over.cropping.    &#9474;
&#9474;     Other propers acceptable are propers based on releases that did not     &#9474;
&#9474;     follow previous guidelines at the time they were pred.                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - Releases containing hardcoded subs may be propered by non-hardsubbed    &#9474;
&#9474;     video. Original release SHALL NOT be nuked.                             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Propering a release when a working fix is released is not allowed.      &#9474;

&#9474;   - WS or FS name tags on the release name are allowed.                     &#9474;
&#9474;   - A WS release after an FS release (and vice versa) requires proof that   &#9474;
&#9474;     the new release contains more picture area than the original release    &#9474;
&#9474;     (provide sample from the original release or JPG screenshot of the same &#9474;
&#9474;     frame in both releases showing additional area). A release not          &#9474;
&#9474;     documenting additional picture area is considered a DUPE.               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Wider wide screen where more of the original source is visible is valid &#9474;
&#9474;     &#38; not considered a dupe but should be tagged as WS not PROPER. Original &#9474;
&#9474;     release should not be nuked. Provide proof as listed above.             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Letterboxed DVDs are not considered FS even if the aspect ratio flagged &#9474;
&#9474;     on the disc is 4:3; only active picture area should be considered.      &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;   - Special Edition releases with same time length as previous released     &#9474;
&#9474;     versions of the movie shall be considered dupes.                        &#9474;
&#9474;   - Shorter cut version of a movie after a longer version was released is   &#9474;
&#9474;     allowed (e.g. THEATRICAL), and MUST be mentioned in the dirname.        &#9474;

&#9474;     in the past and were colour after black&#38;white and vice versa, shall not &#9474;
&#9474;     be unnuked and shall not be duped!)                                     &#9474;
