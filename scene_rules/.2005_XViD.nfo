&#9474; After a long wait and hours of work, I am proud to present, the new XviD    &#9474;
&#9474; scene standards. In this celebration note, I must condemn the leaking of    &#9474;
&#9474; the 2004 draft edition, which was written only for the purpose of helping   &#9474;
&#9474; us all in building this new set of guidelines. I wanna thank everyone who   &#9474;
&#9474; took time to express their ideas and experience into bringing this document &#9474;
&#9474; to life. Also, we shall not forget, all the past teams from 2000 to 2002    &#9474;
&#9474; that made the DivX and XviD scene guidelines available, for TXD2K5 to be    &#9474;
&#9474; built upon. So without further ado, Enjoy!                                  &#9474;

&#9474;   - PAL (25 fps) = MINIMUM runtime is 100 minutes/CD.                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - FILM (23.976 fps) = MINIMUM runtime is 105 minutes/CD.                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - NTSC (29.97 fps) = MINIMUM runtime is 87 minutes/CD.                    &#9474;
&#9474;   - These runtimes are scalable via the following equation:                 &#9474;
&#9474;     N CD time minimum = (N-1) * allowed time where N is number of CDs and   &#9474;
&#9474;     allowable time applies to fps as outlined above:                        &#9474;
&#9474;     i.e. 3 CD FILM rip minimum = 105 x (3-1) = 210 minutes.                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - MINIMUM time length rule is as implied - that is the MINIMUM time per   &#9474;
&#9474;     CD -- NOT MAXIMUM!!! (i.e. no such thing as &#34;must be more than 1 CD&#34;)   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Release runtime must be at least 50 minutes for using the full burnable &#9474;
&#9474;     media capacity. In such cases, releases MUST utilize a MINIMUM of       &#9474;
&#9474;     680mb of the 700mb standard burnable media (Multi-CD releases MUST      &#9474;
&#9474;     conform to the 680mb minimum, for each CD used). Any other use of the   &#9474;
&#9474;     media shall not be over 350mb (Sizes between 350mb to 680mb are not     &#9474;
&#9474;     allowed).                                                               &#9474;
&#9474;   - Media usage is at ripper&#39;s discretion, please use it.                   &#9474;

&#9474;   - MUST be MP3 or Studio AC3 (AC3 transcoding forbidden).                  &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST be STEREO for STEREO sources, MONO for MONO sources                &#9474;
&#9474;     (MONO audio as STEREO on source is considered a MONO source).           &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST BE VBR! NO CBR MP3!                                                &#9474;
&#9474;   - MP3 tracks must have the original frequency as it was on the DVD&#39;s      &#9474;
&#9474;     audio: i.e. 48khz for 48khz and 44.1khz for 44.1khz.                    &#9474;
&#9474;   - MP3 files must be normalized.                                           &#9474;
&#9474;   - ABR is considered a VBR technique.                                      &#9474;
&#9474;   - AC3 MUST be used wisely and correctly. Ripper&#39;s discretion on when to   &#9474;
&#9474;     use it. Using or not using AC3 IS NOT a technical flaw.                 &#9474;
&#9474;   - MONO AC3 is not allowed, in that case must encode to mono MP3.          &#9474;
&#9474;   - Multi-language audio tracks are FORBIDDEN! (Use INTERNAL!)              &#9474;

&#9474;     MUST be &#60;=20 seconds and MUST be inserted according to scene changes    &#9474;
&#9474;     and framesizes as determined by the codec or encoding application.      &#9474;
&#9474;   - Group watermarks of any kind on the video will not be tolerated!        &#9474;
&#9474;   - Intermission messages must be removed from the avi!                     &#9474;

&#9474;   - MUST be as close to original source framerate as possible.              &#9474;
&#9474;   - In some cases PAL movies should be ivtc&#39;d (i.e. to 24fps). Therefore    &#9474;
&#9474;     using a PAL source is not an excuse for lack of ivtc.                   &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;   - MUST BE XviD (all DivX codecs are banned).                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - MUST use 2 pass technique during encoding.                              &#9474;
&#9474;   - NO DUPES BASED ON CODEC TYPE, USE INTERNAL!                             &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;   - Width: 512 - 672 pixels for WS movies (Letterboxed is considered WS).   &#9474;
&#9474;            448 - 576 pixels for FS movies (Only 4:3 images).                &#9474;
&#9474;   - Height and Width: Must be a multiple of 16.                             &#9474;
&#9474;   - Cropping is required to be the MAXIMUM possible (black borders must     &#9474;
&#9474;     be cropped to their maximum). Over cropped releases are considered      &#9474;
&#9474;     a technical flaw. Some movies present changing ARs, in that case the    &#9474;
&#9474;     cropping applies only to the image that presents more pixels (Means     &#9474;
&#9474;     that part of the movie will have bad cropping).                         &#9474;
&#9474;   - Movie encodes must be within 5% of the original aspect ratio.           &#9474;
&#9474;     Calculating AR % error: (Release AR - Original AR)/Original AR x 100    &#9474;

&#9474;   - OPTIONAL (ONLY if all other requirements have been met).                &#9474;
&#9474;   - VOBSUB is the preferred format due to the fact it does not use OCR.     &#9474;
&#9474;     However, any format that displays with DVobSub is acceptable.           &#9474;
&#9474;   - Subtitles may be MUXED with video stream, but MAY NOT be BURNED into    &#9474;
&#9474;     video stream. MUXED subs will proper BURNED subs.                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Subtitles not muxed into video stream MUST be encapsulated in a .rar    &#9474;
&#9474;     file with the MOST compression available and shall be contained in      &#9474;
&#9474;     the directory named &#39;Subs&#39; and will NOT be packaged with main movie     &#9474;
&#9474;     rars.                                                                   &#9474;
&#9474;   - Burned subtitles shall only be permissible when the source exhibits     &#9474;
&#9474;     aforementioned subtitles in the picture itself (i.e. Subs in the        &#9474;
&#9474;     matte portion of the picture MUST be typed in a separate file and the   &#9474;
&#9474;     frame shall be cropped). If there is a part of the burned subtitles     &#9474;
&#9474;     on the picture itself, and another part on the matte portion of the     &#9474;
&#9474;     picture, the frame must be cropped to 2 pixels from the start of the    &#9474;
&#9474;     subtitles on the matte portion. Upside cropping of the picture has      &#9474;
&#9474;     nothing to do with the downside, therefore the cropping on the upside   &#9474;
&#9474;     MUST BE to it&#39;s maximum.                                                &#9474;

&#9474;   - Foreign movies (Non English Spoken) with no English subs, must have     &#9474;
&#9474;     the language name taggings (applies to the various non English          &#9474;
&#9474;     scenes). Movies with English subs present, WILL NOT HAVE any language   &#9474;
&#9474;     tag on them!                                                            &#9474;
&#9474;   - Using of hand made subs on non English releases (i.e. fansubs) MUST     &#9474;
&#9474;     be mentioned in the nfo, and at nuker&#39;s discretion if to nuke the       &#9474;
&#9474;     release for Bad.Subs, depends on how bad the subtitles are. Please      &#9474;
&#9474;     use common judgement! Releases that were nuked for bad subtitles, may   &#9474;
&#9474;     be propered only by subtitles that came from the retail DVD (Ripper&#39;s   &#9474;
&#9474;     choice if to release the full movie again or just the subtitles).       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Multi-language subtitles cannot be used as a basis for a dupe.          &#9474;
&#9474;                                                                             &#9474;

&#9474;   - If DRF average would be over 4.0, the resolution should be lowered if   &#9474;
&#9474;     possible, until the minimal res is reached. See Resolution rules.       &#9474;
&#9474;     DRF average can be checked with DRF Analyzer &#60;It is recommended to      &#9474;
&#9474;     check the full avi file and not just the sample>.                       &#9474;
&#9474;   - Quant. Matrix always has to be H.263/MPEG due to lack of hardware       &#9474;
