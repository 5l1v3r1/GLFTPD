    <pre class="nfo">MP3 Council (un)Official Scene Releasing Standards 2000 

1. An .SFV file must be produced for verifying every release. 
2. An .NFO file must be produced for every release. 

The NFO file must feature at least: 
- Title 
- Artist Name 
- Label 
- Release Date 
- Tracks 
- Genre 
- Encode Bit rate 
- Source 
- Encoder 

Nfo must contain as much information about the release as possible, 
a recommendation is that you place a release notes section in the NFO 

3. Directory standard 

The following are the standards for directory naming: 
Directories must only contain characters; a-z A-Z 0-9 _ . - ( ) 

The filenames cannot contain () through artist neither in dir nor in filename 

All release data will be held within one release directory; no CD1, CD2 directories 

Various Artist releases must start with &#34;VA&#34;, soundtracks with &#34;OST&#34;. 

Underscores and singular periods will be used. No double periods, i.e. &#34;..&#34; 

Length of ALL directories/filenames must no exceed 64 characters. 

Directory naming will follow this format (spaces are used to better display the format): 
Artist Name- Title - Additional Information - Published Year - Group name 
i.e. &#34;artist_-_title-4cd-2000-group&#34; 

Additional information tags are (suggestions): 
VLS - vinyl single (1-2 tracks) 
EP - vinyl maxi-single (2-5+ tracks) 
LP - vinyl full-length album 
CDS - cd single (1-2 tracks) 
CDM - cd maxi-single (2-5+ tracks) 
MD - minidisk 
Promo - promotional 
XX-import 
RETAIL - retail 
... 
etc. 



4. Filename standard 

Files must only contain characters; a-z A-Z 0-9 _ . - () 

Dots are not allowed as replacement for spaces in filenames because it slows down windows 

File naming will follow this format (spaces are used to better display the format): 
Track Number - Artist - Song Title - Additional Info - Group.mp3 


Track numbering example: 
Single CD Release, or non CD and less than 2 sides, cds, etc... 
01-... (track 1) 
02-... (track 2) 
etc. 

Multi CD Releaes, or non CD and more than 1 side, cd, etc... 
101-... (track 1 from cd 1) 
102-... (track 2 from cd 1) 
201-... (track 1 from cd 2) 
202-... (track 2 from cd 2) 
etc. 


For vinyl releases you may also use the naming scheme a1, a2, b1, b2, etc... 

5. Encoding 

One of the following encoders MUST be used: 
- Fraunhofer HQ 
- LAME - http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/ 


Encode Bit rate: 
Only 160JS or 192FS (Not 160FS or 192JS). For comedy or lower quality sources 160JS. 
Encode Bit rate from a quality source 192FS should be used. 

6. No dupes! 

You are not allowed to create a duplicate release from any other source if the original CD 
has already been released. 
You are allowed to create a duplicate release from a source of lower quality. 
(not allowed: vinyl after CD release - allowed: CD after vinyl release) 

A release is a dupe if the complete release (all tracks) is included in ONE previous release. 
Futhermore if a release is different because it has less tracks it is not allowed to be 
released when a release previous to it contained all the tracks from this release. 

7. Mixes must include track listing (in NFO) and a .CUE file if possible (N/A for live mixes). 
8. No self made compilations. (YES DJ Mixes r still allowed) 
9. All ID3 tags must be generated correctly (appropriate information in the correct fields). 
10.The entire CD,Vinyl,etc. must be released (not individual tracks). 
11.Live recordings (from radio) must contain a date when they were broadcast. 
12.Including covers or CD-Extra tracks (videos, etc...) in a release is optional.
