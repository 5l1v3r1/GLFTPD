&#188;      include notes in the NFO as to why the release was tagged that way.    &#188;
&#188;      PROPER.Read.NFO is therefore redundant and should not be used.         &#188;

&#188;      widely between parts, very quiet audio, or audio with excessive        &#188;
&#188;      clipping                                                               &#188;
