| Images must be a minimum of 300 DPI, scaling down is allowed but  |
| to a maximum of 50%. In order for the scalling to be acceptable   |
| the image must stay in its original ratio. The amount of scalling |

|                                                                   |

| **PACKING &#38; DIRECTORY NAMING**                                    |
| Directory&#39;s must be labelled clearly that the release is a CUSTOM |
| release. This is so they do not get confused with Retail scans.   |
| Different versions must be named with .V* to differentiate        |
| between different versions. For Example:                          |
|                                                                   |

|                                                                   |
| or                                                                |
|                                                                   |

| You must always state the word &#34;Covers&#34; in the directory name so  |
| that they are not confused with movie rips. Year is not nescessary|
|                                                                   |
| The files must be rared in either 3mb, 5mb or 10mb volumes.       |
| All releases must have a .sfv file and a .nfo stating any notes   |
| essential to the release. RARS may not have compression.          |
| *3mb = 3,000,000bytes  5mb = 5,000,000bytes 15mb                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                   |
| **PROPERING A RELEASE**                                           |
| A proper is only valid if the original release is lacking in      |
| quality, a proper due to bad dirname or no nfo is not a valid     |
| reason. A group may proper if the file type is not the correct    |
| type as specified earlier in these rules. A custom release may    |
| not be propered but a new Version may be brought out.             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                   |
| **FINAL NOTES**                                                   |
|                                                                   |
| These rules were put in place to avoid bad releases being put in  |
| to the scene, therefore any release not following these rules     |
| will be nuked.                                                    |
